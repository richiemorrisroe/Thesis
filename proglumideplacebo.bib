	opioids in placebo analgesia by using the model of human experimental
	ischemic arm pain. Different types of placebo analgesic responses
	were evoked by means of cognitive expectation cues, drug conditioning,
	or a combination of both. Drug conditioning was performed by means
	of either the opioid agonist morphine hydrochloride or the nonopioid
	ketorolac tromethamine. Expectation cues produced placebo responses
	that were completely blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone. Expectation
	cues together with morphine conditioning produced placebo responses
	that were completely antagonized by naloxone. Morphine conditioning
	alone (without expectation cues) induced a naloxone-reversible placebo
	effect. By contrast, ketorolac conditioning together with expectation
	cues elicited a placebo effect that was blocked by naloxone only
	partially. Ketorolac conditioning alone produced placebo responses
	that were naloxone-insensitive. Therefore, we evoked different types
	of placebo responses that were either naloxone-reversible or partially
	naloxone-reversible or, otherwise, naloxone-insensitive, depending
	on the procedure used to evoke the placebo response. These findings
	show that cognitive factors and conditioning are balanced in different
	ways in placebo analgesia, and this balance is crucial for the activation
	of opioid or nonopioid systems. Expectation triggers endogenous opioids,
	whereas conditioning activates specific subsystems. In fact, if conditioning
	is performed with opioids, placebo analgesia is mediated via opioid
	receptors, if conditioning is performed with nonopioid drugs, other
	nonopioid mechanisms result to be involved.},

	is capable of blocking the placebo analgesic response, both in clinical
	and experimental pain. Second, on the basis of the anti-opioid action
	of cholecystokinin (CCK), the CCK-antagonist, proglumide, has been
	shown to potentiate placebo analgesia in both postoperative and experimentally-
	induced ischemic arm pain. Third, a brain imaging study has shown
	that opioid analgesia and placebo analgesia activate the very same
	regions of the brain. The placebo-activated endogenous opioids have
	been shown to act not only on pain mechanisms, but also on the respiratory
	centers. In addition, in a recent work we found that the placebo
	analgesic response to both phasic and tonic noxious stimuli was accompanied
	by reduced heart rate responses. Naloxone completely antagonizes
	both placebo analgesia and the concomitant reduced heart rate responses.
	All these findings suggest that placebo-activated endogenous opioid
	systems are capable of affecting, either directly or indirectly,
	different body functions, such as pain processing, the pattern of
	respiration, and the cardiovascular system. The activation of endogenous
	substances by placebos also occurs in other pathological conditions,

	proglumide on placebo analgesia in a human model of experimentally

	The placebo effect can thus be modulated in two opposite directions:

	The fact that placebo potentiation by proglumide occurred only in

	little empirical evidence, that placebo analgesia is more likely
	to occur after a successful analgesic therapy. On the basis of this
	assumption, we tested the placebo response in a population of patients
	who were treated with buprenorphine the day before for relieving
	postoperative pain. However, due to the high variability of opioid
	responsiveness, buprenorphine was effective in some patients and

	respiratory depression with a large variability, ranging from mild
	depression to no effect. We found that the placebo analgesic response
	depended on the buprenorphine analgesic effectiveness of the previous
	day. Analogously, we found that a placebo respiratory depressant
	response was more pronounced in those patients with a respiratory
	depressant response to buprenorphine on the day before, irrespective

  abstract = {Despite the increasing research on placebos in recent times, little
	is known about the nocebo effect, a phenomenon that is opposite to
	the placebo effect and whereby expectations of symptom worsening
	play a crucial role. By studying experimental ischemic arm pain in
	healthy volunteers and by using a neuropharmacological approach,
	we found that verbally induced nocebo hyperalgesia was associated
	to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,
	as assessed by means of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol
	plasma concentrations. Both nocebo hyperalgesia and HPA hyperactivity
	were antagonized by the benzodiazepine diazepam, suggesting that
	anxiety played a major role in these effects. The administration
	of the mixed cholecystokinin (CCK) type-A/B receptor antagonist proglumide
	blocked nocebo hyperalgesia completely but had no effect on HPA hyperactivity,
	which suggests a specific involvement of CCK in the hyperalgesic
	but not in the anxiety component of the nocebo effect. Importantly,
	both diazepam and proglumide did not show analgesic properties on
	basal pain, because they acted only on the nocebo-induced pain increase.
	These data indicate a close relationship between anxiety and nocebo
	hyperalgesia, in which the CCKergic systems play a key role in anxiety-induced
	hyperalgesia. These results, together with previous findings showing
	that placebo analgesia is mediated by endogenous opioids, suggest
	that the analgesic placebo/hyperalgesic nocebo phenomenon may involve
	the opposite activation of endogenous opioidergic and CCKergic systems.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing research on placebos in recent times, little
	is known about the nocebo effect, a phenomenon that is opposite to
	the placebo effect and whereby expectations of symptom worsening
	play a crucial role. By studying experimental ischemic arm pain in
	healthy volunteers and by using a neuropharmacological approach,
	we found that verbally induced nocebo hyperalgesia was associated
	to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,
	as assessed by means of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol
	plasma concentrations. Both nocebo hyperalgesia and HPA hyperactivity
	were antagonized by the benzodiazepine diazepam, suggesting that
	anxiety played a major role in these effects. The administration
	of the mixed cholecystokinin (CCK) type-A/B receptor antagonist proglumide
	blocked nocebo hyperalgesia completely but had no effect on HPA hyperactivity,
	which suggests a specific involvement of CCK in the hyperalgesic
	but not in the anxiety component of the nocebo effect. Importantly,
	both diazepam and proglumide did not show analgesic properties on
	basal pain, because they acted only on the nocebo-induced pain increase.
	These data indicate a close relationship between anxiety and nocebo
	hyperalgesia, in which the CCKergic systems play a key role in anxiety-induced
	hyperalgesia. These results, together with previous findings showing
	that placebo analgesia is mediated by endogenous opioids, suggest
	that the analgesic placebo/hyperalgesic nocebo phenomenon may involve
	the opposite activation of endogenous opioidergic and CCKergic systems.},

	of capsaicin, which produces a painful burning sensation. Specific
	expectations of analgesia were induced by applying a placebo cream
	on one of these body parts and by telling the subjects that it was
	a powerful local anesthetic. In such a way, expectancy of the anesthetic
	effect was directed only toward the part on which the placebo cream

	These findings show that a spatially directed expectation of pain

	are the main mechanism underlying gastroesophageal reflux. In the
	present study we evaluated the effect of loxiglumide, a specific
	cholecystokininA (CCKA)-receptor antagonist, on the occurrence of
	TLESRs evoked by gastric distension. METHODS: Eight healthy subjects
	underwent esophageal manometry using a 10-lumen sleeve assembly during
	placebo or loxiglumide (10 mg/kg/h) in a randomized double-blind
	order. Gastric distension was induced by inflation of 400 ml of air.
	RESULTS: Basal lower esophageal pressure (LESP) and swallow-induced
	relaxation were not affected by loxiglumide. Loxiglumide significantly
	reduced the number of TLESRs, from 11.5 (5.8-18.3) to 6.0 (3.3-14.3)
	during the total recording period of 1 h, and from 5.5 (4.25-7.5)
	to 2.0 (0.5-6.8) during the first 15 min. The number of common cavities
	was significantly decreased by loxiglumide, from 8.0 (4.0-20.0) to
	5.0 (2.0-7.8). TLESRs represented the main mechanism (60% during
	placebo, 74% during loxiglumide) underlying common cavities, followed
	by swallow-induced relaxation. CONCLUSIONS: Loxiglumide significantly
	reduces the number of TLESRs triggered by gastric distension without
	interfering with swallow-related relaxation of the lower esophageal
	sphincter, suggesting the involvement of CCKA receptors in the reflex
	pathway mediating TLESRs.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nocebo hyperalgesia is a phenomenon that is opposite
	to placebo analgesia and whereby expectation of pain increase plays
	a crucial role. In recent times, both the neuroanatomical and the
	neurochemical bases of the nocebo effect and of nocebo-related effects
	have begun to be explored. Here, we highlight recent advances in
	our understanding of the neurobiology of the nocebo hyperalgesic
	effect. RECENT FINDINGS: A typical nocebo hyperalgesic response occurs
	following the administration of an inert substance which the subject
	believes to be a hyperalgesic agent (negative placebo or nocebo).
	It has been shown that the subject's negative expectations of pain
	worsening induce anticipatory anxiety about the impending pain increase
	and this triggers the activation of cholecystokinin that, in turn,
	facilitates pain transmission. Accordingly, cholecystokinin antagonists
	have been found to prevent this anxiety-induced hyperalgesia. Brain-imaging
	studies have shown that the perceived intensity of a painful stimulus
	following negative expectations of pain increase is higher than in
	the absence of negative expectations and this is associated with
	changes in activation of specific brain regions. SUMMARY: Since pain
	appears to be amplified by anxiety through the activation of cholecystokininergic
	systems, new therapeutic strategies, such as new cholecystokinin
	antagonists, can be envisaged whenever pain has an important anxiety
	component.},

	on different days, in random order and in a double-blind fashion

	inhibition of the gallbladder contraction for 60 min after the end
	of the meal ingestion. Thereafter, up to the end of the study period,

	300 min after the meal 2.7 +/- 1.6 ml after placebo and 8.2 +/- 3.5

	The aim of this study was to assess the role of cholecystokinin (CCK)
	A receptors in these changes using a CCK-A antagonist loxiglumide.
	METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects were studied on four occasions,
	during which either 0.9% saline or 20% Intralipid was infused intraduodenally
	on two occasions each (1 mL/min) while the proximal stomach was distended
	with air (100 mL/min). During each duodenal infusion, subjects received
	intravenous loxiglumide (10 mg.kg-1.h-1) on 1 day and placebo on
	the other. Intragastric pressure changes were recorded, and the subjects
	reported gastric sensations (fullness, nausea). RESULTS: Loxiglumide
	did not influence gastric motility or sensitivity during duodenal
	saline infusion. Duodenal lipid reduced gastric tonic and phasic
	pressure activity during distensions and induced meal-like fullness
	and nausea; sensations were reported at similar volumes but lower
	intragastric pressures (P < 0.001 vs. saline). Loxiglumide partially
	restored gastric tonic and phasic activity during lipid infusion,
	reduced the occurrence of meal-like fullness and nausea, and increased
	the pressures at which sensations were reported (P < 0.001 vs. placebo).
	CONCLUSIONS: CCK-A receptors are involved in the induction of meal-like
	fullness and nausea associated with intraduodenal lipid and gastric
	distention.},

	was therefore to clarify the role of endogenous cholecystokinin in
	the regulation of insulin release and gastric emptying applying the
	highly potent and specific cholecystokinin receptor antagonist loxiglumide.
	Five healthy volunteers were examined after an overnight fast. Gastric

	a multiple lumen tube in the duodenum and 99mTc-diethylenetriamine

	meals of a) Ensure (containing fat, protein and glucose), and b)
	a pure glucose meal (1.11 mol/l). The meals were given either with
	an intravenous infusion of loxiglumide (22 mumol.kg-1.h-1) or placebo.
	The infusion of loxiglumide markedly accelerated the gastric emptying

	insulin levels during the first postprandial hour, but similar insulin
	levels in the second postprandial hour. Accordingly, we found a close

	tested the hypothesis that alimentary CCK (CCK-A) receptors mediate
	the interaction of CCK with an appetizer on food intake in humans.
	CCK octapeptide (CCK-8, 0.75 microgram infused over 10 min) or saline
	(placebo) with concomitant infusions of saline (placebo) or loxiglumide,
	a specific CCK-A antagonist, was infused into 16 healthy men with
	use of a double-blind, four-period design. All subjects received
	a standard 400-ml appetizer (amounting to 154 kcal) but were free
	to eat and drink thereafter as much as they wished. The effect of
	these infusions on feelings of hunger and satiety and on food intake
	was quantified. CCK-8 induced a reduction in calorie intake (P <
	0.05) compared with saline. Furthermore, a decrease in hunger feelings
	(P < 0.05, saline-CCK-8 vs. all other treatments) and an increase
	in fullness were observed. These effects were antagonized for hunger
	and fullness by loxiglumide. We conclude that CCK-8 interacts with
	an appetizer to modulate satiety in humans. These effects are mediated
	by CCK-A receptors.},

  abstract = {A cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, loxiglumide, was used
	to investigate the potential regulating role of CCK in the entero-insular
	axis in humans. Ingestion of a mixed liquid meal stimulated plasma
	CCK, insulin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release in the control
	experiment. With iv loxiglumide (22 mumol/kg.h), mean plasma insulin
	and glucose levels did not differ between placebo and loxiglumide
	treatment. The area under the plasma concentration for PP was reduced
	to 6,060 +/- 1,706 (P less than 0.05) compared to that during placebo
	treatment (12,266 +/- 4,748). Administration of loxiglumide failed
	to change insulin secretion in response to perfusion of the same
	meal or perfusion of a 10-amino acid solution into the duodenum.
	However, PP secretion in response to the intraduodenal meal or amino
	acid mixture was abolished after loxiglumide (P less than 0.05).
	Intravenous administration of the 10-amino acid mixture stimulated
	insulin from a mean basal level of 7 +/- 3 microU/mL to a peak level
	of 16 +/- 4 microU/mL. Infusion of a CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) at 8.6
	pmol/kg.h, which produced a plasma concentration of 3.3 pmol/L, which
	is within the postprandial range, augmented amino acid-stimulated
	insulin and PP output (P less than 0.05). When CCK-8 was infused
	with loxiglumide, the insulin and PP responses were similar to the
	values found with loxiglumide alone. We conclude that CCK receptor
	blockade with iv loxiglumide does not affect postprandial insulin
	secretion. CCK is, therefore, not a major incretin. However, it is
	involved in the postprandial PP response, especially during the intestinal
	phase stimulation. These data suggest that CCK has a role in the
	human enteroinsular axis.},

	As transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) are
	the major mechanism underlying reflux and can be reduced by cholecystokinin-A

	the postprandial decrease in LES pressure. After 10 weeks of balloon
	treatment, loxiglumide significantly reduced the rate of TLESRs.
	Postprandial LES pressure was significantly increased, whereas the
	meal-induced decrease in LES pressure was absent. Neither loxiglumide
	nor balloon placement affected gastroesophageal reflux. In conclusion,
	CCK(A) receptors play an important role in post-prandial LES pressure
	decrease and are involved in the reflex pathway underlying the triggering
	of TLESRs, at least after balloon placement.},

	the opioid antagonist naloxone. Twenty healthy volunteers (10 men,

	analog scale) taken during the immersion of different surfaces of
	the arm in circulating noxious cold water (12 degrees C). The arm

	Two sessions were increasing (from fingertips to shoulder) and two

	opposed to a gradual recruitment during the increasing session. However,
	during the opioid inhibition session (naloxone injection) no differences

	secretory and motor functions but its physiological role in the control
	of these functions in healthy subjects and duodenal ulcer (DU) patients
	is unknown. METHODS AND SUBJECTS: In this study involving four series
	of young healthy normal and DU subjects, the gastric secretory tests
	were performed under basal conditions and following stimulation by
	modified sham-feeding (MSF), i.v. infusion of caerulein, gastrin
	releasing peptide (GRP) or pentagastrin (p-gastrin) (series A), after
	500 ml of standard meal without or with addition of 15% soybean oil
	(series B) or acidification of meal to pH 2.5 (series C), and finally
	after eradication of Helicobacter pylori (HP) (series D). Studies
	were carried out without or with the pretreatment with placebo or
	loxiglumide, a specific antagonist of type A CCK receptors. In series
	A, the gastric secretion obtained by aspiration technique was measured
	after secretagogues (MSF, caerulein, GRP or p-gastrin), whereas in
	series B, C, and D intragastric pH was measured before and after
	test meal and plasma gastrin, CCK and somatostatin were assayed by
	specific radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, MSF increased
	gastric acid outputs to about 36% of p-gastrin maximum and treatment
	with loxiglumide failed to affect this secretion. Standard meal enhanced
	acid output to about 50% of p-gastrin maximum and raised plasma levels
	of gastrin, CCK but not somatostatin. The pretreatment with loxiglumide
	resulted in further increase both in gastric acid secretion and plasma
	gastrin and CCK, while somatostatin level was significantly reduced.
	Infusion of graded doses of caerulein or GRP resulted in dose-dependent
	stimulation of gastric acid secretion reaching, respectively, 35%
	and 25% of p-gastrin maximum. When loxiglumide was added, the acid
	responses to caerulein and GRP were further increased by 2-3 folds,
	attaining a peak similar to the p-gastrin maximum. Administration
	of loxiglumide resulted in a significant increase in plasma gastrin
	and CCK responses to GRP, whereas plasma somatostatin was not significantly
	altered. Addition of fat to standard meal prolonged gastric emptying
	of this meal by about 50% both in healthy subjects and DU patients
	(series B). Fat in healthy subjects significantly increased and prolonged
	intragastric pH after the meal while reducing the increments in plasma
	gastrin and enhancing plasma CCK without alteration of plasma somatostatin.
	Pretreatment with loxiglumide significantly reduced postprandial
	pH from control 4.8 to 2.5 and reversed the changes in pH caused
	by addition of fat. The increments in plasma gastrin and CCK were
	markedly augmented, whereas those of somatostatin were attenuated.
	DU patients showed lower postprandial pH (3.0) in tests with or without
	fat and higher increments in plasma gastrin. CCK antagonism failed
	to affect significantly the pH profile or the increments in plasma
	gastrin or CCK. CCK antagonism failed to affect significantly the
	pH profile or the increments in plasma gastrin. Intragastric application
	of standard meal of pH 3.0 in healthy subjects and DU patients (series
	C) resulted in significantly lower median 3 h intragastric pH as
	compared to that after meal of pH 6.5. After pretreatment with loxiglumide,
	the median pH after meals of both pHs was significantly lower in
	healthy subjects but not in DU patients. This reduction in pH was
	accompanied by more pronounced increase in plasma gastrin response
	to a meal of pH 6.5 only in healthy controls but not in DU subjects
	and by a significant increase in plasma CCK and decrease in plasma
	somatostatin.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection may be associated with duodenal
	ulcer (DU) and accompanied by increased release of gastrin and deficiency
	of somatostatin (S-S) but the mechanisms of these changes in DU patients
	after eradication of Hp have been little studied. Cholecystokinin
	(CCK) has been implicated in the feedback control of gastric acid
	secretion in healthy subjects but its contribution to secretory disorders
	in DU patients has been little examined. This study, therefore, investigated
	whether CCK participates in the impairment of postprandial gastrin
	release and gastric acid secretion in active DU patients. Tests were
	undertaken in 10 DU patients without or with elimination of the action
	of endogenous CCK using loxiglumide (LOX), a selective CCK-A receptor
	antagonist, before and 4 wk. after eradication of Hp with triple
	therapy (omeprazole, amoxycillin and bismuth). In Hp positive DU
	patients, the postprandial acid secretion (measured by continuous
	intragastric pH monitoring) was accompanied by a pronounced increment
	in plasma gastrin with negligible increase of intraluminal release
	of S-S. The administration of LOX in these patients did not affect
	significantly the postprandial pH profile and the rise in plasma
	gastrin. After eradication of Hp the median postprandial intragastric
	pH increased to about 4.3 (compared to 3.5 before the Hp eradication);
	the postprandial gastrin concentration was reduced by about 40%,
	while luminal release of S-S was increased 2 folds. The administration
	of LOX resulted in significantly greater decrease in median pH (3.1)
	and higher rise in postprandial plasma gastrin in these patients.
	Also the postprandial plasma S-S showed a small, but significant
	decline (by about 25%) as compared to that in placebo treated patients.
	This study provides evidence that: (1) Hp infection in DU patients
	is accompanied by enhanced gastrin release and the reduction in luminal
	release of S-S; (2) The failure of LOX to affect gastric secretion
	and plasma gastrin DU Hp infected patients could be attributed, at
	least in part, to the failure of endogenous CCK to control gastric
	acid secretion via release of S-S; (3) Hp infected patients appear
	to exhibit a deficiency of S-S release that can be reversed by the
	eradication of Hp indicating that both peptides may contribute to
	the acceleration of the ulcer healing following Hp eradication in
	DU patients; (4) The test with LOX and gastric luminal S-S assay
	may be useful in identification of Hp positive DU patients with CCK-mediated
	impaired feedback control of gastric secretion and deficiency of
	S-S caused by Hp infection.},

	against acute injury in experimental animals but little is known
	about the role of this hormone in maintaining mucosal integrity in
	humans. This double-blind, placebo controlled study was performed
	in 16 healthy volunteers. It describes the effects of CCK-8 infused
	intravenously (i.v.) at physiological doses and endogenous CCK released
	by intraduodenal (i.d.) oleate on gastric mucosal damage, as brought
	about by ethanol without or with pretreatment with loxiglumide, a
	selective CCK-A receptor antagonist. METHODS: CCK-8 was infused i.v.
	30 min before and throughout the study or i.d. oleate was instilled
	through a separate duodenal tube. Thirty minutes after the start
	of i.v. infusion of CCK or i.d. oleate instillation, 100 ml of 50%
	ethanol spray was applied to the gastric mucosa using an endoscope.
	Gastroscopy was performed and mucosal lesions were quantified using
	modified Lanza score. Gastric biopsies were taken from oxyntic mucosa
	for histological evaluation and gastric content was aspirated for
	radioimmunoassay of somatostatin. RESULTS: In placebo-treated subjects
	ethanol caused endoscopic damage, with an average score of 2.8+/-0.2.
	Histologically, a widespread disruption of surface epithelium and
	deep hemorrhagic necrotic lesions were observed. Pretreatment with
	CCK or i.d. oleate markedly reduced the endoscopic lesion score to
	0.7+/-0.1 and 0.3+/-0.1, respectively, and in both cases this reduction
	was accompanied by a significant rise in plasma CCK. Histologically,
	surface epithelium was still disrupted but deep necrotic lesions
	were absent. Gastric content collected before and after CCK or oleate
	showed a several-fold increase of luminally released somatostatin.
	CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with loxiglumide abolished the protective
	effects of i.v. CCK-8 and i.d. oleate on mucosal lesions induced
	by ethanol and prevented the rise in intragastric somatostatin, but
	failed to affect the increments in plasma CCK. Endogenous CCK plays
	a physiological role in the maintenance of mucosal integrity. This
	occurs through activation of CCK-A receptors and is associated with
	an increased gastric luminal release of somatostatin.},

  abstract = {This study was designed to determine the role of cholecystokinin in
	the control gastric acid secretion in men using loxiglumide, a specific
	cholecystokinin receptor blocker. Three groups of healthy subjects
	(A, B, and C) were used; group A--for studies with postprandial gastric
	secretion, group B--for studies with exogenous gastric secretagogues
	and group C--for 12 hour intragastric pH-metry. Cephalic phase stimulated
	by modified sham feeding in group A subjects increased gastric acid
	secretion to about 50% of pentagastrin maximum and the treatment
	with loxiglumide in a standard dose (20 mumol/kg iv loading dose
	plus infusion of 20 mumol/kg/h afterwards) failed to affect this
	secretion. Gastric acid response to a 5% peptone meal instilled intragastrically
	greatly enhanced gastric acid secretion and plasma gastrin concentration
	but the addition of loxiglumide in the standard dose resulted in
	further increase in both gastric acid and plasma gastrin responses
	to peptone meal. Infusion of caerulein in gradually increasing doses
	(15-120 pmol/kg/h) and gastrin releasing peptide (25-200 pmol/kg/h)
	resulted in a dose dependent stimulation of gastric acid secretion
	reaching about 35% and 25% of maximum attained with pentagastrin.
	When loxiglumide was added in a standard dose, the acid responses
	to caerulein and gastrin releasing peptide were further increased
	two to three fold attaining the peak reaching, respectively, about
	100% and 50% of pentagastrin maximum. In group C subjects, 12 hour
	pH-metry revealed the usual increase in gastric pH after each meal
	in tests with placebo. Loxiglumide (1200 mg tablets tid, po) resulted
	in significantly lower pH after each meal and this was accompanied
	by significantly higher gastrin responses than in placebo tests.
	We conclude that cholecystokinin released by peptone meal, ordinary
	meals or gastrin releasing peptide exerts a potent inhibitory influence
	on gastric acid secretion and gastrin release in men and this inhibition
	involves subtype A cholecystokinin receptors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased gastric emptying and defective action of endogenous
	cholecystokinin (CCK), that is known to inhibit this emptying, have
	been implicated in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer (DU). The aim
	of this double blind study was to assess whether CCK and somatostatin
	participate in the impairment of gastric motility in active DU patients
	before and after Helicobacter pylori eradication. METHODS: Tests
	were undertaken in 10 DU patients without or with elimination of
	the action of endogenous CCK using loxiglumide, a selective CCK-A
	receptor antagonist, before and 4 weeks after eradication of H. pylori
	with 1 week triple therapy that resulted in healing of all DUs tested.
	The gastric emptying rate after feeding was determined using the
	13C-acetate breath test. Before each test, samples of gastric juice
	were obtained by aspiration using a nasogastric tube for determination
	of somatostatin using specific radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Prior to
	H. pylori eradication gastric emptying half-time was 31 +/- 6 min
	in placebo-treated DU patients and this emptying rate was not significantly
	affected in tests after pretreatment with loxiglumide (10 mg/kg i.v.).
	Following eradication of H. pylori, in tests with placebo gastric
	emptying half-time was significantly longer (48 +/- 9 min) compared
	to that prior to H. pylori eradication. Pretreatment with loxiglumide
	in H. pylori eradicated DU patients significantly enhanced the gastric
	emptying rate with an emptying half-time of only 33 +/- 4 min. Eradication
	of H. pylori resulted in a significant increase in somatostatin concentration
	in gastric juice and loxiglumide significantly reduced this luminal
	somatostatin in H. pylori-eradicated subjects compared to values
	before anti-H. pylori therapy. CONCLUSIONS: 1) H. pylori infection
	in DU patients is accompanied by enhanced gastric emptying and reduction
	in luminal release of somatostatin; 2) the failure of loxiglumide
	to affect gastric emptying in H. pylori-infected DU patients might
	be attributed, at least in part, to the failure of endogenous CCK
	to control gastric motility due to deficient release of somatostatin;
	and 3) H. pylori-infected patients appear to exhibit a deficient
	somatostatin release by endogenous CCK that can be reversed by the
	eradication of H. pylori indicating that both CCK and somatostatin
	may contribute to normalization of gastric emptying following H.

	10 young healthy subjects and 10 duodenal ulcer (DU) patients, 500
	ml of a standard meal without or with addition of 15% soybean oil
	was given, and the gastric emptying rate and the pH profile and plasma
	levels of gastrin, CCK, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and somatostatin
	were determined in separate tests with placebo or with antagonism
	of type-A CCK receptors (loxiglumide, 1200 mg orally). RESULTS: In
	healthy controls and DU patients the emptying half-time was 44 and
	34 min, respectively, and the addition of oil prolonged the emptying
	by about 50%. Pretreatment with loxiglumide significantly reduced
	fat-induced retardation of gastric emptying in both healthy controls
	and DU patients. A standard meal in healthy subjects resulted in
	an immediate rise in median gastric pH to about 6.0, and this was
	followed by gradual decrease within about 3 h to premeal values of
	about 2.0. After the meal, plasma gastrin rose by 57%, CCK by 177%,
	PP by 100%, and somatostatin by 39%. Addition of fat significantly
	attenuated and prolonged the pH decrease after the meal while reducing
	the increment in plasma gastrin and enhancing plasma CCK and PP levels.
	Loxiglumide significantly reduced the median postprandial pH (from
	control 4.8 to 2.5) and reversed the changes in the pH profile caused
	by the addition of fat. The increments in plasma gastrin and CCK
	were markedly augmented, whereas those of somatostatin and PP were
	significantly attenuated. DU patients showed lower postprandial pH
	(3.0) in tests with or without fat and higher increments in plasma
	gastrin. CCK antagonism failed to affect significantly the pH profile
	or the increments in plasma gastrin in DU patients. CONCLUSIONS:
	These results indicate that endogenous CCK released by a fatty meal
	delays gastric emptying and inhibits gastric acid and plasma gastrin
	responses in healthy subjects, but in DU patients the inhibitory
	effect of CCK is less pronounced, suggesting a defect in the action
	of this hormone on gastrin release and gastric acid secretion.},

	simultaneous assessment of gastric emptying and motility. MATERIALS
	AND METHODS: Gastric emptying and motility were measured in nine
	volunteers after ingestion of a liquid meal. A specially designed
	MR imaging protocol was used that allowed simultaneous assessment
	of gastric emptying (spatial resolution, 1.5 mm; corrected for gastric
	secretion volume) and gastric motility (temporal resolution, 1.2
	seconds; spatial resolution, 3.1 mm). To evaluate the ability to
	detect small changes in gastric motor activity with findings from
	this method, the influence of a prokinetic agent (loxiglumide) on
	gastric emptying and motility was tested in five volunteers. RESULTS:
	Each contraction could be individually visualized at MR imaging.
	Administration of loxiglumide resulted in decreased gastric half-emptying
	time (mean +/- 1 standard error of the mean, 88.1 minutes +/- 6.3
	for the placebo and 39.1 minutes +/- 6.7 for loxiglumide) and increased
	gastric motility (contraction frequency, 2.26 contractions per minute
	+/- 0.15 for the placebo and 3.04 per minute +/- 0.04 for loxiglumide).
	CONCLUSION: MR imaging makes it feasible to study gastric emptying
	and gastric motility and to determine the influence of drugs on gastric
	motor activity.},

  abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated that administration of cholecystokinin
	(CCK) reduces food intake in several species, including humans. In
	animal studies CCK-receptor antagonists have been reported to increase
	food intake, suggesting a physiological satiety effect of CCK in
	these animals. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we investigated
	the effect of the specific CCK-A receptor antagonist loxiglumide
	on food intake (carbohydrate-rich meal) and on subjective hunger
	feelings scored with visual analogue scales and food selection lists
	in seven healthy obese women and in seven healthy lean women. Loxiglumide
	was administered intravenously in a dose of 10 mg/kg ideal weight/h.
	For the whole group, food intake during loxiglumide (359 +/- 39 g)
	was not significantly different from food intake during saline infusion
	(333 +/- 31 g). Also, when the lean and obese subgroups were analyzed
	separately, no significant influence of loxiglumide on food intake
	was found. In addition, no significant differences in satiety scores
	were seen using the food selection lists or visual analogue scales.
	In conclusion, in the present study during infusing the CCK-A receptor
	antagonist loxiglumide we found no increase in preprandial satiety
	nor in food intake of a carbohydrate-rich meal nor in postprandial
	satiety in lean and obese women.},

	the placebo group. Survival in group A was higher than in group B
	(p = 0.0003). In group B, survival was lower in females (F) than
	in males (M) (F = 61.00 +/- 6.47 days, M = 140.44 +/- 22.15 days;
	p = 0.012), while survival by sex was similar in group A and in global
	analysis. Survival by treatment was similar for groups A and B. Survival
	by surgery was higher (p = 0.049) for surgical palliation than for
	nonoperated patients. The tumor grade affected survival but it did
	not vary by therapy. In conclusion, sure efficacy of loxiglumide
	in advanced pancreatic cancer was not demonstrated by our results.
	In consideration of its documented tumor growth inhibiting action,
	we suggest that loxiglumide be tested for recurrence prevention after
	resective surgery.},

  abstract = {1. The aim of investigation was to establish and compare the reversibility
	of tolerance to the antitransit effects of morphine by three different
	procedures: (a) acute inflammation of the gut, (b) lorglumide a cholecystokininA
	(CCKA) receptor antagonist, or (c) MK-801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate
	(NMDA) receptor ion channel blocker. The type of interaction between
	morphine and lorglumide or MK-801 on the inhibition of gastrointestinal
	transit (GIT) in naive animals was also evaluated. 2. Male Swiss
	CD-1 mice were implanted with 75 mg of morphine base or placebo pellets.
	Gastrointestinal transit was assessed with a charcoal meal and results
	expressed as % inhibition of GIT. Inflammation was induced by the
	intragastric (p.o.) administration of croton oil (CO), while controls
	received castor oil (CA) or saline (SS). Morphine was administered
	by subcutaneous (s.c.) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection,
	to naive and tolerant animals treated with CO, CA or SS. Dose-response
	curves for s.c. morphine were also performed in naive and tolerant
	mice receiving 5.2 or 7.4 nmol (s.c.) lorglumide or MK-801, respectively.
	3. The ED50 values for inhibition of GIT by s.c. morphine were: 45.9
	+/- 2.7 and 250.1 +/- 3.1 nmol in naive and tolerant animals, respectively,
	demonstrating a five fold decrease in the potency of morphine. In
	naive animals, inflammation (CO) decreased the ED50 of morphine three
	times (14.4 +/- 2.2 nmol). However, no tolerance to s.c. morphine
	(ED50 16.4 +/- 2.6 nmol) was manifested during intestinal inflammation.
	After i.c.v. administration, a similar degree of tolerance to morphine
	was observed (4.8 fold decrease in potency). Intestinal inflammation
	had no effect on the ED50 values of i.c.v. morphine in naive and
	tolerant animals, showing that reversal of tolerance is related to
	local mechanism/s. Mean values for intestinal pH were 6.9 +/- 0.04
	and 6.2 +/- 0.04 in SS and CO treated mice, respectively. In addition,
	morphine was 74 times more potent by the i.c.v. than by the s.c.
	route (naive-SS). 4. Morphine and lorglumide interacted synergistically
	in naive animals; in addition, the administration of lorglumide reversed
	tolerance to s.c. morphine. No interaction (additivity) was observed
	in naive animals when morphine and MK-801 were administered in combination.
	However, the drug completely reversed tolerance to the antitransit
	effects of morphine. 5. The present investigation shows that acute
	inflammation of the gut reverses tolerance to the antitransit effects
	of s.c. morphine by a peripheral mechanism. Qualitatively similar
	results were obtained after the administration of lorglumide or MK-801.
	Our results suggest that a local decrease in pH could play an important
	role during inflammation, while antagonism of endogenous compensatory
	systems would explain the reversal of tolerance induced by lorglumide
	or MK-801.},

	is mediated by the release of beta-endorphin. In addition to subjective
	pain reports, we included an objective physiological parameter of
	nociception reflected by the opioid sensitive nociceptive R-III reflex.
	Placebo consisted of strong suggestions of pain relief and an intravenous
	injection of saline. Forty minutes after placebo, either the opioid
	antagonist naloxone or saline was administered intravenously without
	subjects noticing (hidden). Sixty healthy males, aged 18-30 years,
	voluntarily participated in this study. Subjects were randomized
	into one of four groups: group 1 received placebo and hidden naloxone,
	group 2 received hidden naloxone only, group 3 received placebo and
	hidden saline and group 4 received hidden saline only. Pain was induced
	by electrical stimulation of the sural nerve and evaluated with a
	visual analogue scale (VAS). In addition, changes in the magnitude
	of the nociceptive R-III reflex activity were assessed. We determined
	to what extent R-III reflex activity and subjective pain reports
	were decreased by placebo and we investigated whether these placebo-induced
	changes in reflex activity and subjective pain reports were naloxone
	reversible. Furthermore, we measured the degree of association between
	pain relief as measured on VAS and changes in R-III reflex activity.
	Finally, the role of beta-endorphin was assessed by measuring plasma
	endorphin levels before and after the administration of placebo.
	This study could not demonstrate a placebo effect as measured on
	VAS and R-III responses. The administration of placebo did not appear
	to have an effect on the release of beta-endorphins. Consistently,
	the antagonizing effects of naloxone were negligible. A subgroup
	analysis of those who did show a placebo response as indicated on
	the VAS did not support the supposition that beta-endorphin is released
	due to placebo suggestion. It is suggested that intensified stimuli
	and a more effective procedure to induce placebo analgesia (e.g.
	conditioning) may produce a proper placebo effect. (C) 2000 International

	suggest: (i) CCK secretion is under feedback control by intraduodenal
	bile acids and to a lesser extent by pancreatic enzymes; (ii) simultaneous
	extraction of CCK and loxiglumide results in circulating plasma CCK-like
	bioactivity of zero; (iii) gastrin secretion is feedback controlled

	of gastric acid secretion is still controversial. This study examined
	the effect of the CCK-A receptor antagonist loxiglumide (lox) on
	gastrin- or CCK-induced gastric acid secretion and meal-stimulated
	plasma gastrin levels in a placebo-controlled study. METHODS: Acid
	output was studied in eight subjects who received intravenously gastrin-17
	(15, 30, and 60 pmol.kg-1.h-1); gastrin-17 plus lox; cholecystokinin
	octapeptide (CCK-8) (15, 30, and 60 pmol.kg-1.h-1); CCK-8 plus lox;
	or gastrin plus CCK-8. Sham feeding-induced acid output and meal-stimulated
	gastrin secretion were studied during lox infusion. RESULTS: Gastrin-17
	dose-dependently stimulated acid output to near-maximal levels. CCK-8
	(15 pmol.kg-1.h-1) increased acid secretion 2.5-fold over basal;
	higher infusion rates had less or no effect. When combined with lox,
	CCK-8 produced a near-maximal acid response (6-fold over basal).
	CCK-8 together with gastrin-17 inhibited gastrin-induced acid output
	by 67%. Meal-stimulated plasma gastrin concentrations were elevated
	3.2-fold, whereas sham feeding-induced acid secretion was not modified
	by lox. CONCLUSIONS: Blockade of CCK-A receptors converts CCK-8 into
	a potent acid secretagogue and augments postprandial gastrin secretion.
	A CCK-mediated stimulation of paracrine somatostatin secretion from
	antral and fundic D cells represents a candidate mechanism for the
	inhibition of the parietal and gastrin cell in humans.},

	METHODS: The effect of the CCK-A antagonist loxiglumide (LOX) on
	GE and motility was studied using magnetic resonance imaging in six
	healthy volunteers after ingestion of 500 ml Intralipid 10% (550
	kcal). Subjects were studied in the supine position on two occasions
	during intravenous infusion of LOX (66 mumol/kg/h for 10 min followed
	by 22 mumol/kg/h) or placebo. GE was determined every 15 minutes
	using transaxial abdominal scans and motility was studied by means
	of 120 coronal scans, 1.2 seconds apart. For each coronal image the
	proximal and distal (antral) diameters were measured at a fixed point
	in the stomach to determine contraction frequency (ACF) and amplitude
	(AMP). RESULTS: GE was faster during LOX infusion than placebo (t1/2
	31 (22) versus 115 (67) minutes, p < 0.03). There was little variation
	in the diameter of the proximal stomach with either LOX or placebo.
	In the distal stomach marked contractile activity was observed during
	LOX (ACF 2.9 (0.2) versus 1.5 (2.9) during placebo, p < 0.01). AMP
	also increased during LOX compared with placebo (56 (22)% versus
	27 (16)%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The increases in antral motility
	are likely to contribute to the acceleration of GE and suggest that
	CCK may regulate GE by acting on the distal stomach although an effect
	on the proximal stomach cannot be excluded.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cholecystokinin (CCK)-receptor antagonists have been
	found to markedly reduce the severity of pancreatitis and improve
	survival in experimental animal models of acute pancreatitis. CCK
	appears to play an important role in the development and progression
	of acute pancreatitis, and the recent development of CCK antagonists
	has provided a new approach to the treatment of acute pancreatitis
	in humans. AIMS: The therapeutic efficacy of a CCK-A receptor antagonist,
	loxiglumide, in patients with painful acute attacks of chronic pancreatitis
	was evaluated. METHODOLOGY: A multicenter dose-response controlled
	trial was conducted at 110 institutions in Japan from June 1993 to
	December 1994. Chronic pancreatitis was diagnosed for all patients
	on the basis of the Japanese criteria for chronic pancreatitis. Two-hundred
	seven patients were randomized to oral treatment with loxiglumide
	(300, 600, and 1,200 mg/d) or placebo for 4 weeks. The efficacy of
	treatment was evaluated on the basis of clinical symptoms, physical
	signs, and serum pancreatic enzyme levels. The groups were comparable
	with respect to age, sex, etiology, complications, and previous treatment.
	RESULTS: The improvement rate of the abdominal and/or back pain was
	46% in the loxiglumide 300-mg group, 59% in the 600-mg group, and
	52% in the 1,200-mg group, and it was 36% in the placebo group (600
	mg versus placebo: p < 0.05). The physical signs evaluated--abdominal
	tenderness and resistance--improved in all three loxiglumide groups,
	and the serum pancreatic amylase and trypsin levels decreased significantly
	in the 600-mg group (p < 0.05). The overall clinical improvement
	rate was 46% in the 300-mg loxiglumide group, 58% in the 600-mg group,
	and 52% in the 1,200-mg group, and it was 34% in the placebo group.
	CONCLUSION: These results indicate that oral administration of loxiglumide
	may be useful in the treatment of patients with acute, painful attacks
	of chronic pancreatitis, and 600 mg/d is recommended as a beneficial
	dosage.},

	the increase in transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations
	(TLOSR) frequency and fall in lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure
	seen after ingestion of a meal. Studies in animals and healthy volunteers
	suggest that cholecystokinin (CCK) may play a role. AIM: To study
	the role of CCK in postprandial LOS function using the CCK antagonist
	loxiglumide. SUBJECTS: 10 asymptomatic volunteers (7 male, 20-29
	years) and 9 patients with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux
	(4 male, 33-66 years). METHODS: Oesophageal, LOS and gastric pressure
	and oesophageal pH readings were recorded for 1 h before and 2 h
	after intragastric infusion of a 200 kCal, 300 mL long chain triglyceride
	meal. Each subject underwent two studies and received intravenous
	loxiglumide or placebo infusion in randomized order. RESULTS: During
	placebo infusion, postprandial LOS pressure fell [volunteers: 17
	(9-31) to 7 (1-19) mmHg (P < 0.01), patients: 15 (6-26) to 9 (2-21)

	to 2 (0-7) per hour (P=0.01), patients: 0 (0-3) to 2 (0-10) per hour

	generally low magnitudes of placebo analgesia (N. Engl. J. Med. 344
	(2001) 1594). However, as studies included in their analysis used
	only placebo as a control condition, we conducted two meta-analyses,
	one in which 23 studies used only placebo as a control condition,
	and one in which 14 studies investigated placebo analgesic mechanisms.
	Magnitudes of placebo analgesic effects were much higher in the latter
	(mean effect size = 0.95) as compared to the former (mean effect
	size = 0.15) and were significantly different (P = 0.003). This difference
	as well as differences in effect sizes within studies of placebo
	mechanisms may be parsimoniously explained by differences in expected
	pain levels produced by placebo suggestions and by conditioning.
	Furthermore, some of the studies of placebo analgesic mechanisms
	indicate that the magnitude of placebo analgesia is higher when the
	placebo analgesic effect is induced via suggestion combined with
	conditioning than via suggestion alone or conditioning alone. Based
	on these findings, we suggest that placebo analgesic effects are
	most optimally conceptualized in terms of perception of the placebo
	agent, and therefore a new definition of placebo response is proposed.

	after ingestion of a fat-rich meal. The aim of the study was to test
	the hypothesis that postprandial sleepiness is mediated by cholecystokinin
	(CCK) acting on CCK-A receptors. A double-blind crossover study was
	conducted. Twelve male volunteers ate a high-fat morning meal [54%
	energy fat, 41% energy carbohydrate (CHO)]. On one day they received
	an i.v. infusion of Loxiglumide, a CCK-A receptor antagonist (30
	mg/kg/h for 10 min then 10 mg/kg/h for 3 h 10 min). On another day
	the protocol was repeated except a saline placebo infusion was given
	at similar rates as the Loxiglumide, starting 20 min before the meal.
	Subjects' mood and sleepiness were monitored throughout using questionnaires
	and performance tasks. The results indicate that ratings of vigour
	were significantly lower during the Loxiglumide infusion than during
	the saline infusion, [F(1,10) = 6.65; p = 0.027]. Subjects who were
	infused with Loxiglumide on their first test day felt significantly
	(p < 0.05) more fatigued, sleepy and tense and less vigorous, less
	efficient and had lower energetic arousal during the Loxiglumide
	infusion than during the saline infusion. In conclusion, the results
	suggest that the postprandial decline in feelings of alertness after
	a fat-rich meal is not mediated solely by CCK acting through CCK-A
	receptors.},
