	Religiosity, pessimism, anxiety, obsession-compulsion, death obsession,

	among their American counterparts. On the other hand, self-ratings
	of mental health and optimism were significantly higher among the
	Americans than their Kuwaiti counterparts. Religiosity was significantly
	and positively associated with ratings of physical health, mental
	health, and optimism (both countries), and negatively with pessimism,
	anxiety, suicidal ideation, and ego-grasping (Kuwaitis), and pessimism
	and suicidal ideation (Americans). A factor analysis of the correlational
	matrix yielded in both countries two independent factors labeled
	"Normality vs. psychopathology", and "Religiosity, health, and optimism".
	Backward multiple regressions revealed that the main predictors of
	religiosity were mental health, optimism and physical health positively,
	and obsession-compulsion and ego-grasping negatively in Kuwaitis;
	and optimism positively and anxiety, and suicidal ideation negatively
	in Americans. By and large, those who consider themselves as religious
	were more healthy and optimistic, and obtained lower scores on psychopathology
	in both countries. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  journal = {European Journal of Social Psychology},
  volume = {23},
  pages = {13p},
  number = {6},
  abstract = {An experimental study assessed the impact of positive versus negative
	mood inductions on health-related judgments with respect to both
	self-appraisal of health (present health status, future health risks,
	unrealistic optimism) and appraisal of unhealthy behaviours' noxiousness
	compared to an untreated control condition. With respect to self-appraisal
	of health it was hypothesized that there should be stronger effects
	of negative mood than of positive mood, but that there should also
	be a mood by specific judgment task interaction. With respect to
	unhealthy behaviours' noxiousness ratings it was assumed that positive
	mood leads to higher noxiousness ratings than negative mood. The
	findings show that 23 per cent of the rating variances can be explained
	by the mood factor. In accord with the predictions self-appraisal
	of health was more negative under negative mood, but -- with one
	exception -- not more positive under positive mood than in the respective
	control condition. The exception relates to a measure of unrealistic
	optimism. Also in accord with the prediction positive mood led to
	higher noxiousness ratings of unhealthy behaviours than negative
	mood. All mood effects were independent of the respondents' sex,
	health locus of control and of the number of illness days during
	the previous year. Under an applied perspective it is discussed how
	negative mood may exert a double detrimental influence on health
	care, whereas positive mood does not lead to a happy go lucky attitude.

  title = {Addiction-specific support group use, personality characteristics
	and recovery status in substance abusers: A follow-up study},
  year = {2000},
  abstract = {This thesis is a prospective, three-month follow-up study of 228 of
	mixed-substance, mixed-gender sample of substance-abusing clients
	who entered a private addiction rehabilitation hospital for residential
	treatment. The goal was to try and predict recovery status and use
	of addiction-specific supports (aftercare and 12-step programs) at
	the three-month follow-up point, as half of all relapses occur within
	this time frame. The variables tested were psychological and social.
	Little is known about the psychological characteristics of those
	who maintain gains of treatment and of those who attend addiction-specific
	support groups following treatment. This study aimed at filling this
	void with useful and applicable findings. The psychological factors
	examined here were Alexithymia (difficulty in identifying and verbally
	describing feelings) as measured by the revised Toronto Alexithymia
	Scale (TAS-20); optimism, measured by the Revised Life Orientation
	Test (LOT-R); and beliefs regarding the disease versus the free-will
	models of addictions, as measured by the Addiction Belief Scale (ABS).
	The use of support groups was used both as a potential predictor
	(of recovery status) and as an outcome variable. Recovery status
	and the level of use of support groups were assessed from data gathered
	at the three-month follow-up telephone interview. To assess recovery
	status, baseline information was compared to post-treatment level
	of substance use. Multiple sources of confirmation of clients' reports
	regarding post-treatment behaviour were used. The most striking finding
	of this study was the fact that all the clients who attended the
	aftercare program regularly or aftercare and 12-step groups combined,
	were in high recovery (abstinent or highly improved) during the first
	three months post treatment. Attendance in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
	groups alone was also significantly associated with recovery status
	at three months. In addition, two of the three psychological variables
	(Alexithymia and Addiction Beliefs) were significantly associated
	with level of aftercare use. Additional analysis included an examination
	of demographic data as potential predictors of outcome and a gender
	analysis which was limited in scope by the small number of women
	in the study. An added outcome variable was the completion of the
	initial treatment program. The significant findings of all analyses
	are reported and discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA,

  abstract = {Objective: This paper, composed by an interest group of clinicians
	and researchers based in Melbourne, presents some background to the
	practice of mindfulness-based therapies as relevant to the general
	professional reader. We address the empirical evidence for these
	therapies, the principles through which they might operate, some
	practical questions facing those wishing to commence practice in
	this area or to refer patients into mindfulness-based therapies,
	and some considerations relevant to the conduct and interpretation
	of research into the therapeutic application of mindfulness. Method:
	Databases (e.g. PsycINFO, MEDLINE) were searched for literature on
	the impact of mindfulness interventions, and the psychological and
	biological mechanisms that underpin the effects of mindfulness practice.
	This paper also draws upon the clinical experience of the author
	group. Results: Mindfulness practice and principles have their origins
	in many contemplative and philosophical traditions but individuals
	can effectively adopt the training and practice of mindfulness in
	the absence of such traditions or vocabulary. A recent surge of interest
	regarding mindfulness in therapeutic techniques can be attributed
	to the publication of some well-designed empirical evaluations of
	mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Arising from this as well as
	a broader history of clinical integration of mindfulness and Western
	psychotherapies, a growing number of clinicians have interest and
	enthusiasm to learn the techniques of mindfulness and to integrate
	them into their therapeutic work. This review highlights the importance
	of accurate professional awareness and understanding of mindfulness
	and its therapeutic applications. Conclusions: The theoretical and
	empirical literatures on therapeutic applications of mindfulness
	are in states of significant growth and development. This group suggests,
	based on this review, that the combination of some well-developed
	conceptual models for the therapeutic action of mindfulness and a
	developing empirical base, justifies a degree of optimism that mindfulness-based
	approaches will become helpful strategies to offer in the care of
	patients with a wide range of mental and physical health problems.

	methods and structural equation modeling (SEM). Methods Two population
	data sets were used. A stratified representative sample ( n = 1,005)
	of the Greek general population was approached for interview. This
	survey containing the SF-36 was used to obtain component score coefficients
	from principal components analysis and orthogonal rotation. These
	coefficients were then used in the second data set ( n = 1,007) of
	the Greek adult general population to compute scores for the physical
	component summary and the mental component summary of the SF-36.
	The second data set was also used to obtain factor scores for physical
	and mental health measures, applying SEM. Results Exploratory factor
	analysis supported the existence of two principal components that
	are the basis for summary physical and mental health measures. SEM
	showed that models assuming that physical and mental health are correlated
	provided a better fit to the data than models assuming independence
	between physical and mental health. However, all eight dimensions
	of SF-36 should be included in the construction of summary scores.
	Conclusions These results confirm the multidimensional structure
	of the SF-36, the correlational equivalence between standard summary
	measures and SEM-based second-order factor scores, and underscore
	the feasibility of multinational comparisons of health status using

  title = {Associations of mindfulness, perceived stress, and health behaviors
	in college freshmen},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {U.S. college students perceive stress as the greatest health impediment
	to academic performance. When stressful occurrences are greater than
	coping resources, students experience debilitative setbacks influencing
	their ability to persist to degree completion. Freshmen tend to have
	more difficulty dealing with stress, exhibiting greater susceptibility
	to engaging in high risk health behaviors (e.g., physical inactivity,
	unhealthy nutrition and substance abuse). Mindfulness programs may
	be an effective behavioral strategy for transforming student coping
	responses, but implementation must be predicated on understanding
	relationships of mindfulness to perceived stress, self-efficacy,
	and health behaviors. This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive
	design to examine these associations by means of a Web-based survey
	in a large southwestern university. First-time transitioning freshmen
	students (9,275, aged 18 to 22 years) were recruited through university
	email, Fall semester, 2007. Participant response rate was approximately
	22 percent (2,029 respondents), similar to online national health
	survey response rates. Questionnaires composing the survey included:
	(1) Demographics; (2) Health Behavior [items from National College
	Health Assessment, Healthstyle Self-test, Baecke Physical Activity
	Questionnaire, and 36-item Short-form Health Survey]; (3) Perceived
	Stress Scale; (4) Mindful Attention Awareness Scale; (5) Kentucky
	Inventory of Mindfulness Skills; and, (6) General Self-efficacy Scale.
	Data collection was completed in November, 2007. Self-report assessments
	were evaluated with Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis to
	compare relationships of mindfulness and perceived stress, general
	self-efficacy and health behaviors. Higher dispositional mindfulness
	was significantly correlated with higher self-efficacy, lower perceived
	stress and less high risk health behaviors. This study included investigation
	of similarities and differences between male and female respondents.
	Significant differences in age and mean body mass index existed between
	genders, and female students reported significantly higher perceived
	stress scores than their male counterparts. These findings enhance
	previous understanding of college freshmen perceptions and behaviors,
	suggesting that mindfulness programs may improve coping skills, decrease
	stress levels, and improve health habits for freshmen transitioning
	into college. Implications include the confronting of challenges
	and coping response efforts of students throughout their college
	experience, possibly mitigating dropout rates and increasing university
	retention. Investigation of influences of mindfulness programs on
	university retention rates should be a priority. (PsycINFO Database

  abstract = {Objectives: Executive coaches are often involved in working with executive
	managers. The objective of this study is to investigate whether teams
	are more engaged and productive when led by an optimistic manager.
	Furthermore, we hypothesise that optimistic managers embody positive
	leadership--employing a strengths-based approach, maintaining a positive
	perspective, and frequently providing recognition and encouragement--which
	increases the engagement and productivity of their employees. Design:
	The study used a cross-sectional survey design at two time points.
	Method: The researchers developed a survey to measure this concept
	of positive leadership. In addition, two measures were used: the
	Life Orientation Test Revised (LOT-R) to measure optimism and the
	Gallup Organisation's Qतछतऑ to measure engagement. Results: In a
	cross-sectional study of 86 employees and 17 managers in an Information
	Technology (IT) organisation, positive leadership correlated with
	employee optimism, engagement, and project performance. When we looked
	at a subset of this data prospectively, with 39 employees and 14
	managers, manager optimism predicted project performance. Conclusions:
	Our data support the claim that positive leadership is correlated
	with employee engagement and performance, and further extends the
	importance of optimism in the workplace. Coaching implications are
	also discussed, in terms of exploring how coaching psychologists
	can work with executives to develop their managerial style. (PsycINFO

	coping experiences related to competitive pressure and expectations
	to perform. Specifically, the subjects were asked to discuss their
	most and least effective coping experience in elite sport. Study
	participants were comprised of 61 contenders for or members of the
	U.S. national rowing and/or Olympic teams. 61 elite rowers completed

  title = {The relationship between body image dissatisfaction and psychological
	health: An exploration of body image in young adult men},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {This study examined the relationship between body dissatisfaction
	and psychological health. Several scholars have suggested that body
	image is an increasingly relevant issue for men. There is also increasing
	literature suggesting that factors such as muscularity, a central
	component of body image in men, may be related to psychological health.
	However, limitations in current measurement make it unclear how meaningful
	such findings are. Furthermore, few extant studies in the general
	body image literature have examined the role of positive psychological
	coping variables. Therefore, this study sought to examine the relationship
	between body dissatisfaction and psychological health. It was hypothesized
	that body dissatisfaction would be positively correlated with symptoms
	of psychological distress, and negatively correlated with indices
	of positive psychological adjustment. Furthermore, it was hypothesized
	that the indices of positive psychological adjustment (satisfaction
	with life, proactive coping, hardiness, and optimism) would moderate,
	or buffer, the relationship between body dissatisfaction and the
	indicators of psychological distress (depression, symptom reports,
	self esteem). It was also hypothesized that the Male Body Attitudes
	Scale, a new measure of body dissatisfaction in men, would demonstrate
	adequate reliability and validity. In this study, 368 male participants
	recruited from an introductory psychology class took ten measures:
	the General Health Questionairre-28, the Center for Epidemiological
	Studies-Depression Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale, the Satisfaction
	with Life Scale, the Psychological Hardiness Scale, the Proactive
	Coping Scale, the Life Orientation Test-Revised, the Male Body Dissatisfaction
	Scale, the Drive for Muscularity Scale, and the Drive for Muscularity
	Attitudes Questionnaire. Participants also completed a demographics
	questionnaire that asked for information regarding race, age, sexual
	orientation, year in school, weight, height, and sports participation.
	Correlational analysis was used to examine the hypothesis regarding
	the relationship between body dissatisfaction and the psychological
	health indices, and hierarchical moderated regression analysis was
	used to examine the buffering hypothesis. Furthermore, MANOVA was
	used to assess the demographic variables, and ANOVA was utilized
	to test for order effects. Maximum likelihood analysis was utilized
	to impute missing data values before initiating these analyses. The
	first main hypothesis of this study, that body image dissatisfaction
	would be positively related to indices of psychological distress,
	and negatively related to indicators of positive psychological adjustment,
	was supported. The second main hypothesis of this study, that the
	relationship between body image dissatisfaction and indices of psychological
	distress would be moderated by the indicators of positive psychological
	adjustment, was not supported overall. The reliability of the MBAS
	overall scale and its three subscales, as well as the convergent
	and concurrent validity of these scales, was supported. These results
	support the practical significance of body image for men. (PsycINFO

	A cross-sectional descriptive design was used with questionnaires
	as the means of data collection. The study population comprised a
	randomized stratified sample of students from a small university
	in southern Sweden. Ethical approval was obtained from the vice chancellor,
	and the issues of informed consent, confidentiality, privacy and
	self-determination were respected. Two instruments were used for
	data collection; the 29-item Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, and
	an instrument created for this study, named Personality and Health
	Instrument, containing 52 questions. Self-rated health was estimated
	by inverse number of health complaints. A factor analysis identified
	seven factors related to personality traits; the three most important
	were hardiness, positive affect/optimism and Type A personality.
	The personality trait variables were tested for correlation with
	each other as well as with self-rated health. The mean score for
	SOC was similar for female and male students, but a positive association
	between SOC and self-rated health was found only among women. Optimism
	was associated with less health complaints among female students.
	Type A personality was associated with poorer health both among women
	and men. The personality traits SOC, positive affect/optimism, hardiness
	and alienation showed high internal correlations. The SOC scale is
	discussed in relation to gender specificity and in relation to methodological
	and conceptual confounding. Further research is needed to explore
	the relation between SOC, optimism, hardiness, hostility and health.
	The significance of the study is that it raises questions about the
	validity and specificity of the SOC instrument and provides ideas
	for future research to develop the sense of coherence concept and

	use. We performed logistic regression to determine demographic and
	disease factors associated with use of different CAM therapies (including

	We also measured quality of life (QoL) using the SF36 and optimism

	among CAM users and nonusers. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of respondents
	used CAM. Younger age was the most consistent correlate of CAM use,
	but factors associated with CAM use varied by type of CAM. Chemotherapy
	was associated with use of relaxation/imagery (OR 1.3 95%CI 1.1-1.7).
	Radiotherapy was associated with use of high-dose vitamins (OR 1.5
	95% CI 1.2-2.0). Tamoxifen or anastrozole treatment was associated
	with use of homeopathy (OR 0.5 95%CI 0.3-0.9). Users of most types
	of CAM had worse QoL scores than nonusers, but better QoL was found
	among users of yoga. The lowest QoL scores were associated with the
	use of energy healing. Optimism was higher among users of relaxation/imagery.
	CONCLUSIONS: Factors associated with CAM use varied according to
	type of CAM. Our finding of worse QoL among women using energy healing
	and better QoL among women using yoga suggests the need for longitudinal
	studies to determine the temporal relationships between these therapies
	and QoL.},

	behavior in Division I athletes. Optimism and Pessimism did not affect
	athletes' overall practice of superstitious behaviors. Athletes who
	had lesser beliefs in God-mediated control were less likely to be
	optimistic. A lesser belief in God-mediated control emerged as a
	slight predictor of less belief in the effectiveness of superstitions
	and therefore, less usage of superstitious behaviors. Individual

	to different ritual habits than male athletes (Buhrmann, Brown, &

	Participants were 50 inpatients being evaluated for heart transplant.
	Coping was measured using the COPE Inventory ( 1 ) (J Pers Soc Psychol,
	56, 1989, 267). Quality of life was assessed using the SF-36 ( 2
	) (Health Survey: Manual and Interpretation Guide, Quality Metric
	Inc, Lincoln, RI, 2000). Results: Higher education and less seeking
	of social support were independently associated with better physical
	functioning. Higher use of denial was associated with poorer mental
	health functioning. Conclusions: In patients with significant physical
	limitations, years of education appears to be protective. Less seeking
	of social support was associated with better physical functioning
	perhaps because individuals who feel better physically do not feel
	the need to elicit support. Alternatively, the tendency to not seek
	assistance could stem from personality characteristics such as avoidance
	or optimism. Denial was associated with worse mental health functioning.
	Denying the existence of a stressor may be a high risk coping strategy
	for patients who are pre-transplant and even more dangerous for those
	who are post-transplant given the need to be alert to symptoms. Proactive
	identification of patients at risk for poorer quality of life will
	allow for more timely psychosocial interventions, which could impact

	healing refers to any form of healing that one or more individuals
	perform at a distance, using nonphysical means, with the intent of
	improving the well-being of another person or organism. A time-series
	control group design experimental approach was used to address these
	questions. One group received distant healing for 4 weeks ( n = 12);
	the other group received no additional treatment ( n = 8). Participants
	were clients and clinicians recruited from a local mental health
	clinic. All participants completed 5 measures at 3 different times

  abstract = {Although it is well documented that an optimistic orientation is beneficial
	when coping with stressful life events, I proposed that prior to
	a major life transition a realistic orientation (giving thought to
	both positive and negative possibilities) is most adaptive. Two studies
	were conducted to assess the effect of a realistic orientation in
	the context of the transition to motherhood. In study 1, designed
	to establish validity and reliability of a new self-report measure
	of realistic orientation, 181 women, pregnant with their first child,
	were assessed on their orientation to motherhood (OM), optimism-pessimism
	(LOT-R), personality traits and depressive affect. In addition to
	establishing some reliability and validity for the scale, Study 1
	indicated that OM significantly predicted depression scores over
	and above optimism. Women demonstrating a realistic orientation did
	not differ significantly from the more positively oriented group
	on depressive affect, however, they were significantly different
	from the more negatively oriented group, who reported the most depressive
	symptomatology. Study 2 was designed to assess the benefits of a
	realistic orientation after women give birth and undertake the transition
	to motherhood. In Study 2, 69 women expecting their first child were
	interviewed during the third trimester of pregnancy, and again 3
	months postnatal. Orientation to motherhood, personal projects, depressive
	affect, and psychological well-being were assessed at the prenatal
	interview, and all but the OM scale were assessed at the postnatal
	interview. Findings of this prospective study indicated that a realistic
	orientation during pregnancy is associated with lower levels of depressive
	affect, higher levels of psychological well-being (controlling for
	prenatal depression and well-being) and more adaptive restructuring
	of personal projects at postnatal than either a positive or negative
	orientation, particularly when the transition was accompanied by
	negative surprises. The data suggest that a prenatal orientation
	to motherhood that includes thoughts of positive and negative possibilities
	facilitates a smoother transition to motherhood. More generally,
	the data suggest that a realistic orientation may be adaptive insofar
	as it fosters anticipatory coping activity. (PsycINFO Database Record

	correlational pilot. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Fifteen PP and 15
	SP patients receiving their first ICD were enrolled. Mean ages (+/-
	SD) were 65.7+/-11.3 and 67.9+/-7.7 respectively. METHODS: Mishel's
	Uncertainty in Illness Scale (MUIS-C), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
	(STAI) and the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) were taken pre-implant,
	at the first post-implant visit, and at 1 month. Measures were compared

	t=0.67; t(df)=28; p=0.507). LOT-R scores were 15.67+/-3.8 for PP
	and 16.47+/-3.6 for SP; t=0.59; t(df)=28; p=0.557. Pre-implant state
	anxiety scores were (mean PP=37.40+/-10.0, SP=37.73+/-13.6; t=0.076;

	state anxiety (F(2,56)=3.61, p<0.05), where both groups showed lower
	scores. CONCLUSION: This study identified moderately high uncertainty
	in PP and SP patients prior to receiving their ICD. Though uncertainty
	was high, both groups reported an optimistic disposition and normal
	anxiety. At 1-month, SP patients had higher uncertainty scores than
	PP patients. This post-intervention uncertainty among patients who
	experienced an arrhythmic event warrants attention from nurses caring
	for ICD patients. Interventions to ameliorate uncertainty should
	be tailored to consider ICD indication.},

  year = {2003},
  abstract = {The disturbing and pervasive adverse consequences of the high rate
	of marital discord and divorce highlight the need for expanded preventive
	efforts. Recent research shows that stress and poor stress coping
	abilities are crucial determinants of relationship quality and stability
	(Karney & Bradbury, 1995), yet existing prevention programs have
	not targeted stress and coping. Using a randomized wait-list controlled
	design, this study evaluated the impact upon clinically non-distressed
	couples of a manualized group relationship enhancement intervention
	modeled on the mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction program
	(Kabat-Zinn, 1990). Dependent measures assessed not only relationship
	functioning but also individual well-being. Summary measures were
	administered before and after the intervention and 3 months later,
	and daily measures were recorded for 2 preintervention weeks and
	the final 3 weeks of the 8-week program. Hypotheses predicted the
	mindfulness condition would be superior to the wait-list condition
	on both summary and daily measures. Attrition from the two conditions
	was equal, and the final sample consisted of 44 couples (37 married,
	7 cohabitating) evenly divided between conditions. No significant
	pretest condition differences were found on dependent measures, demographics
	or expectancy. Attendance during the intervention was good, and participants
	averaged 32 min. per day of mindfulness homework practice. As predicted,
	at posttest the mindfulness condition demonstrated superior outcomes
	on summary relationship measures (relationship distress, Global Distress
	Scale; relationship satisfaction, Quality of Marriage Index; autonomy
	and relatedness, Autonomy & Relatedness Inventory; acceptance of
	partner, visual analogue scale [VAS]) and individual measures (psychological
	distress, Brief Symptom Inventory; optimism, LOT-R; spirituality,
	INSPIRIT; relaxation, VAS). Multilevel model analyses of daily VAS
	measures provided a finer-grained confirmation, showing improvements
	in day-to-day relationship stress, relationship happiness, and individual
	stress coping efficacy. Those who spent more time practicing mindfulness
	had better outcomes, and well-controlled within-person analyses showed
	greater practice on a given day led to decreased relationship stress
	and increased relationship happiness on the following day. Follow-up
	summary results showed maintenance of benefits. This study provides
	strong evidence for the effectiveness of the mindfulness program
	in preventing relationship distress. Future research could examine
	ways of enhancing the program's effects, especially for couples facing
	difficult stressors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all

  volume = {In Press, Corrected Proof},
  abstract = {Optimism is an individual difference variable that reflects the extent
	to which people hold generalized favorable expectancies for their
	future. Higher levels of optimism have been related prospectively
	to better subjective well-being in times of adversity or difficulty
	(i.e., controlling for previous well-being). Consistent with such
	findings, optimism has been linked to higher levels of engagement
	coping and lower levels of avoidance, or disengagement, coping. There
	is evidence that optimism is associated with taking proactive steps
	to protect one's health, whereas pessimism is associated with health-damaging
	behaviors. Consistent with such findings, optimism is also related
	to indicators of better physical health. The energetic, task-focused
	approach that optimists take to goals also relates to benefits in
	the socioeconomic world. Some evidence suggests that optimism relates
	to more persistence in educational efforts and to higher later income.
	Optimists also appear to fare better than pessimists in relationships.
	Although there are instances in which optimism fails to convey an
	advantage, and instances in which it may convey a disadvantage, those
	instances are relatively rare. In sum, the behavioral patterns of
	optimists appear to provide models of living for others to learn

	Web of Knowledge, the Cochrane database, and the references of retrieved
	articles. The search included articles written in English published
	prior to September 2008, and identified ten, mainly low-quality,
	studies. Cohen's d effect size between meditators and controls on
	stress reduction and spirituality enhancement values were calculated.
	Results: MBSR showed a nonspecific effect on stress reduction in
	comparison to an inactive control, both in reducing stress and in
	enhancing spirituality values, and a possible specific effect compared
	to an intervention designed to be structurally equivalent to the
	meditation program. A direct comparison study between MBSR and standard
	relaxation training found that both treatments were equally able
	to reduce stress. Furthermore, MBSR was able to reduce ruminative
	thinking and trait anxiety, as well as to increase empathy and self-compassion.
	Conclusions: MBSR is able to reduce stress levels in healthy people.
	However, important limitations of the included studies as well as
	the paucity of evidence about possible specific effects of MBSR in
	comparison to other nonspecific treatments underline the necessity
	of further research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Background/Context: Although mindfulness originated in Eastern meditation
	traditions, notably Buddhism, researchers, clinicians, and, more
	recently, educators suggest that the cultivation of mindfulness may
	be beneficial to Westerners uninterested in adopting Buddhist or
	other Eastern spiritual traditions. Mindfulness is understood as
	sets of skills that can be developed with practice and taught independently
	of spiritual origins as a way of being or relating to present-moment
	experience. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This
	pilot study adds to this literature on mindfulness training for nascent
	mental health professionals, who may be at risk for occupational
	stress and burnout. This study aims to (1) expand on preliminary
	research supporting the helpfulness of mindfulness interventions
	for graduate students in psychology and (2) investigate the feasibility
	and helpfulness of a novel adaptation of mindfulness-based stress
	reduction (MBSR) that emphasizes relational awareness. Population/Participants/Subjects:
	This sample consisted of clinicians-in-training (N = 21) within a
	graduate department of counseling and clinical psychology at an urban
	university. All students were in their first or second year of graduate
	school; 20 participants were enrolled in a psychology master's program,
	and 1 participant was a doctoral student in clinical psychology.
	Intervention/Program/Practice: The authors investigated a novel 6-week
	interpersonal mindfulness training (IMT) program modeled after the
	manualized MBSR intervention, with an added emphasis placed on relational
	awareness. IMT aims to reduce perceived stress and enhance interpersonal
	well-being and, as such, may be particularly well-suited for psychotherapy
	trainees. IMT was integrated into a semester-long graduate course
	in psychology. Research Design: A pre-post design was used to examine
	outcomes associated with participation in IMT. Findings/Results:
	Results suggest that IMT with psychology graduate students is a feasible
	intervention that positively affects mindfulness, perceived stress,
	social connectedness, emotional intelligence, and anxiety. Of special
	interest are changes in interpersonal well-being that suggest potential
	benefits for future mental health professionals. Conclusions/Recommendations:
	High attendance rate and positive program evaluations suggest that
	IMT can be successfully taught within a graduate psychology curriculum.
	We suggest that mindfulness training may be a useful complement to
	the standard training of future clinicians. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	coping strategies mediate the relationship between optimism and psychological
	and physical quality of life for women with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
	(SLE). It was conducted as an exploratory investigation, so effects
	of all 14 coping strategies represented by the subscales of the Brief

	optimism measured by the LOT-R and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)

	support for the partial mediation of optimism and psychological quality
	of life by seven coping strategies. Greater optimism influenced the
	use of active coping, positive refraining, acceptance, and emotional
	support, which were related to better psychological quality of life.
	Optimism also influenced the use of denial, behavioral disengagement,
	and self blame, which were related to poorer psychological quality

	influence on psychological quality of life and that use of some coping
	strategies including planning, instrumental support, and self distraction
	resulted in poorer physical quality of life. A sample size of 314

	This study explored factors which might explain the variability.
	The study's purpose was to determine the extent to which role demand,
	social problem solving, and optimism explain the variance in well-being
	of multiple role women. The sample consisted of 90 women who worked
	at least 20 hours per week at several private and public agencies.
	Participants filled out an assessment package and returned it directly
	to the examiner or through the mail. Role demand was measured by
	number of hours spent completing role responsibilities. Optimism
	was measured by the Life Orientation Test-Revised. Social Problem
	Solving was assessed by the Problem Solving Skills Scale of the Social
	Problem Solving Inventory. Well-being was measured by the Mental
	Health Inventory, Social Well-being Index, and Symptoms List. Results
	indicated that optimism explained a significant percentage of the
	variance in well-being of multiple role women. Role demand as measured
	in hours was not related to well-being of multiple role women, however,
	perceptions of role overload were negatively correlated with well-being
	and perceptions of reward were positively correlated with well-being.
	Social problem solving did not explain any variance in well-being

	1, 32 healthy young adults (23 women, 9 men) were assigned randomly
	to either a meditation, progressive muscular relaxation or wait-list
	control group. Each participated in two laboratory sessions 4 weeks
	apart in which they practiced their assigned technique. In Study
	2, using a within-subjects design, 30 healthy young adults (15 women,
	15 men) participated in two laboratory sessions in which they practiced
	meditation or listened to an audiotape of a popular novel in counterbalanced
	order. Heart rate, cardiac respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and

	derived from impedance cardiography were obtained in Study 2. Results:
	In both studies, participants displayed significantly greater increases
	in RSA while meditating than while engaging in other relaxing activities.
	A significant decrease in cardiac pre-ejection period was observed
	while participants meditated in Study 2. This suggests that simultaneous
	increases in cardiac parasympathetic and sympathetic activity may
	explain the lack of an effect on heart rate. Female participants
	in Study 2 exhibited a significantly larger decrease in diastolic
	blood pressure during meditation than the novel, whereas men had
	greater increases in cardiac output during meditation compared to

	It was found that the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale was a
	useful process measure to assess changes in mindfulness and that
	the Coping with Health Injuries and Problems questionnaire was useful
	in documenting changes in palliative (self-care) coping over the
	course of the 8 week program. Moreover, the Sense of Coherence questionnaire
	suggested that the women viewed life as more meaningful and manageable

  year = {1999},
  abstract = {This experiment sought to generalize findings by Seligman et al. (1990),
	that pessimism is predictive of deterioration in performance after
	negative false feedback. Using a different population (average college
	students) and a different task (grammar, arithmetic, & recode) allowed
	results supporting these findings to be generalized. Pessimism has
	been defined differently by attribution [Expanded Attributional Style
	Questionnaire (EASQ), Peterson, & Villanova, 19881 and expectancy
	[Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), Scheier, Carver, & Bridges,
	1994; and the optimism & Pessimism Instrument (OPI), Dember et al.,
	1989] theorists. Therefore, pessimism in this study was defined by
	structural similarities among these three instruments. It was hypothesized
	that this conjoint pessimism (cP) would be positively correlated
	with performance decline (decrease in performance accuracy and/or
	speed) after negative false feedback. Moreover, the LOT-R and the
	OPI were expected to be better predictors of performance decline
	than the EASQ but not as potent a predictor as cP. Ninety-two students
	(65 women and 27 men, mean age = 19.80, SE =.41) were recruited from
	the Introductory Psychology subject pool at the University of Miami
	and given course credit for their participation. Participants were
	tested individually and debriefed about the deceptive methods employed
	by the researcher. Pessimism (cP), a bipolar construct primarily
	defined by the structural similarities between the LOT-R and the
	OPI, was predictive of performance deterioration, as measured by

	determining factors of these effects. In this study, the relationships
	between these factors and the expected side effects were investigated.
	Methods: The participants (118 undergraduate university students)
	were asked to rate the estimated probability of occurrence of ten
	non-specific side effects for six different looking tablets, and
	to fill out several personality questionnaires (STAI-T, LOT-R, PHQ-15,
	SSAS). Results: Significant differences among the tablets were found
	for every side effect. Good predictors of the expected severity of
	side effects were the Somatization tendency (PHQ-15) and the somatosensory
	amplification (SSAS). According to the path-analysis, trait-anxiety
	and gender had only indirect effects (via PHQ-15 and SSAS) upon the
	expected severity of side effects, and dispositional optimism had
	no effect at all. Discussion: The look-and-feel of a given curative
	can evoke a specific pattern of non-specific side effects, while
	personality characteristics have an impact upon the expected severity
	of these effects. Non-specific side-effects can influence medication
	in multiple ways: e.g. via decreasing compliance or amplifying specific
	side effects (interaction). These factors should be taken into account
	when deciding the look-and-feel of curatives (intelligent medicine
	designing). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)

	aimed at examining the determinants of good health and successful
	ageing in an area of deprivation. In this paper we report findings
	from the quantitative data related to two of the original eight research

	to psychological/personality variables? and (2) What is the role
	of religious beliefs and [`]spirituality' in healthy ageing? Study
	design In-depth interview study in which standardized measures of
	personality and beliefs were administered, along with measures of
	beliefs devised for the study. Methods One hundred matched pairs
	of healthy and unhealthy [`]agers' were interviewed face-to-face.
	Healthy ageing was assessed in terms of hospital morbidity and self-reported
	health. The sample comprised 106 males and 94 females (53 male matched
	pairs and 47 female matched pairs) ranging in age from 70 to 90 years
	of age with the majority (n=165) falling into the 71-80 age group
	and the remaining 35 in the 81-90 age group. All study participants
	were survivors of the Paisley/Renfrew (MIDSPAN) survey, a longitudinal
	study commenced in 1972 with continuous recording of morbidity and
	mortality since. Questionnaires assessing extraversion, neuroticism,
	psychoticism, health locus of control, sense of coherence, optimism,
	and religiosity were filled in by participants during the interviews.
	Results Compared to the unhealthy group, the healthy participants
	were less neurotic, more likely to endorse an internal locus of control

	variables: empathy, narcissistic gratification, idealization, externalization,
	and criticalness/devaluation. Participants were 44 patient-therapist

	Design: MS patients (N = 127), who participated in a larger, randomized
	clinical trial comparing two types of telephone psychotherapy for
	depression, were assessed at baseline, midtherapy (8 weeks), end
	of therapy (16 weeks), and 6- and 12-month posttherapy. Main Outcome
	Measures: Depression was measured with a telephone administered version
	of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; Positive Affect was
	measured with the Positive Affect Subscale from the Positive and
	Negative Affect Scale; Optimism was measured with the Life Orientation
	Test--Revised; Benefit-Finding was measured with the revised version
	of the Stress-Related Growth Scale. Results: Data were analyzed with
	multilevel random-effects models, controlling for time since MS diagnosis
	and type of treatment. Improved depression was associated with increased
	benefit-finding over time. The relationship between improved depression
	and benefit-finding was significantly mediated by both increased
	optimism and increased positive affect. Conclusion: Findings provide

	correlation with successful adjustment to starting college. The major
	transition from high school to college can be a difficult adjustment
	for many students, similar to the transition from middle school to
	high school. The present study aims to expand on the existing literature
	by examining college freshman's overall adjustment to college as
	a function of optimism, choice of coping strategies, and parental
	attachment. A sample of 150 college freshman completed a self-report
	questionnaire packet including the Life Orientation Test-Revised
	(LOT-R), The Brief COPE, the Parental Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ),
	and the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ). Results
	indicate that persons identified as optimistic, with secure parental
	attachment, also were identified as having successful adjustment
	to college. The use of active coping methods also were found to be
	related to a successful adjustment to college, while avoidant coping
	methods were related to less successful college adjustment. Past
	research indicates that the coping strategies employed by optimists
	are more favorable than pessimists, accounting for some of their
	successful adjustment during stressful times. Therefore, it was hypothesized
	that active coping methods would mediate the relationship between
	optimism and adjustment to college; this hypothesis was supported.
	The results suggest that active coping mediates the relationship
	between optimism and adjustment to college. However, the hypothesis
	suggesting active coping mediates the relationship between a secure
	parental attachment and adjustment to college was not supported in
	this study. A multiple regression analysis revealed that optimism,
	in contrast to coping strategies and parental attachment, is the
	most predictive factor contributing to successful college adjustment.
	However, secure parental attachment was also identified as supporting
	successful college adjustment. The findings of this study have important

  abstract = {Historically, the focus of psychological research has been on psychopathology,
	rather than on adaptive strengths. This study clarifies the taxonomical
	and conceptual differences between optimism, pessimism, and hopelessness,
	which are often used arbitrarily in psychological literature. A case
	is made for the inclusion of positively valenced variables in suicide
	risk assessment and prevention efforts. Two hundred eighty-four college
	students completed the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II),
	Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS),
	Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire (EASQ), Life Orientation
	Test-Revised (LOT-R), and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability

	Factor analyses suggest that the LOT-R and EASQ-R assess independent
	constructs, and that each measure is one-dimensional in nature, contributing
	to the debate about the construct validity of the LOT-R. A moderator
	model of suicide ideation was also proposed and supported. Controlling
	for depression and social desirability, positive scores on measures
	of dispositional optimism/pessimism and optimistic/pessimistic explanatory
	style weakened the relationship between hopelessness and suicide
	ideation. This suggests that these forms of optimism may be a protective
	factor against thoughts of suicide. Current results help to conceptualize
	and operationalize the constructs of optimism, pessimism and hopelessness.
	Implications for researchers and clinicians include improved predictability

	the world's religions and is also articulated in a number of secular
	discourses. The therapeutic potential of mindfulness is now being
	recognized and is being researched in a diverse range of healthcare

	individuals whose awareness is not impaired do have a choice in what
	phenomena they attend to and how they act. For the psychiatric nurse,
	understanding the idea and practice of mindfulness is useful for
	developing both trans-cultural awareness and to recognize that personal
	inattention could compromise care. In terms of mental health promotion,
	mindfulness is worthy of consideration as an important life skill.
	This paper explores the notion of mindfulness from a number of perspectives.
	The paper does not claim to have explored all the options. The Buddhist
	understanding of mindfulness provides the perspective for continuity
	within the paper and is used to illuminate any similarities and differences

  year = {2006},
  abstract = {Advances in medical technology have extended the survival rate and
	length of life for people with life-threatening illnesses (Goodheart
	& Lansing, 1997). As a result, many psychotherapists may increasingly
	find themselves working with seriously ill people. Psychotherapy
	research has found the relationship between the therapist and the
	client, termed the working alliance (Bordin, 1979), to be both an
	immediate and an intermediate indicator of therapeutic change, as
	well as a primary contributor to therapeutic outcome (Horvath & Symonds,
	1991). While client characteristics and attitudes associated with
	therapeutic outcome have been investigated, optimism and hope in
	relation to the alliance have not been examined. Research has shown
	that individuals with generally positive expectancies about the future
	tend to display superior adaptation in coping with medical stressors
	and illness (Tennen, Affleck, Urrows, Higgins, & Mendola, 1992).
	The present study examined medically ill clients' optimism and hope
	in relation to the working alliance. It was hypothesized that clients
	with high dispositional optimism and high state hope would perceive
	the strongest alliance. Clients who had life-altering medical conditions
	were sampled in various Veterans Affairs clinics and independent
	psychotherapy practices. Volunteers who had been in psychotherapy
	for a minimum of 3 sessions completed the Life Orientation Test-Revised
	(LOT-R; Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), the Hope Scale (Synder
	et al., 1997), the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI; Horvath & Greenberg),
	and a demographic questionnaire. Contrary to prediction, the present
	results did not support the hypothesis that higher hope and optimism
	scores would predict more favorable client perceptions of the working
	alliance. Only one covariate, treatment setting, uniquely predicted
	WAI scores, with clients in independent practice reporting stronger
	alliances with their therapists. Although optimism and hope were
	not significant, their addition to the equation accounted for 3%
	of the incremental variance. Limitations of the study are discussed,
	particularly the heterogeneity of the sample in terms of illness
	and other demographic characteristics. Recommendations for future
	research are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all

  year = {2002},
  abstract = {This archival study examined the relationship between perceived optimism
	and age on coping with a threat of prostate cancer. Men's perceptions
	of personal vulnerability and anxiety when faced with a cancer threat
	are explored in an attempt to understand how the relative stress
	associated with diagnostic biopsy experiences may vary according
	to one's coping skills and general outlook on life. Participants
	in the study were 60 men, ages 46 to 83 years, who had recently been
	screened for cancer with a prostate biopsy. The men's level of coping
	effort and optimism were evaluated using two measures of self-reported
	appraisal of coping and optimism perception, The Brief COPE and the
	Life Orientation Test-Revised version. The analysis supported two
	of the expected effects based on the application of Janz and Becker's
	(1984) health belief model, Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) model of
	coping and appraisal, Carver and Scheier's (1990) appraisal of behavioral
	self-regulation, and Seligman's (1990) model of learned optimism.
	The two principal findings of correlation and univariate analyses
	were that younger age (men 46 to 65 years) and higher pain levels
	were significantly associated with greater situational coping effort
	in this sample of well-educated, financially secure, Caucasian men.
	Although findings of this study did not confirm a relationship between
	optimism and coping effort, as the research literature suggests,
	this may be due to the fact that the men of this sample reported
	disproportionately high optimism. A larger sample may yield a more
	normative distribution and thus, a clearer picture of the relationship
	between these variables. Possible explanations for these findings
	are discussed along with policy recommendations and suggestions for
	future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the relationship of dispositional optimism, health
	locus of control and self-efficacy to quality of life (QOL) in older
	subjects differing in level of disability and institutionalisation.
	METHODS: The study was conducted in the three groups of subjects
	aged >/= 65: 110 relatively healthy community-dwelling elderly, 102
	independent elders who voluntarily decided to live in veteran home
	and 112 inhabitants of a long-term care home. Life orientation test-revised
	(LOT-R), multidimensional health locus of control (MHLC) and generalised
	self-efficacy scale (GSES) together with a multidimensional assessment
	were performed with each subject. QOL was assessed using the Euroqol
	5D questionnaire, the Nottingham health profile and the satisfaction
	with life scale (SWLS). RESULTS: QOL generally decreased with growing
	level of dependence and institutionalisation. LOT-R, MHLC and GSES
	were important and independent correlates of QOL in all three environments
	of older subjects. The relationship of education, smoking habit,
	physical activity, strength and mobility measures to psychological
	characteristics was different in the three groups of elders. LOT-R,
	MHLC Powerful Others, MHLC Chance and GSES were the most important
	QOL correlates in veteran home group, while MHLC Internal was most
	significant in long-term care home inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: Data
	of this cross-sectional study suggests that the veteran home elderly,
	as a group 'in transition' between community and institution, should
	be the first target of psychological preventive and health-promoting
	measures aimed at improving QOL in older population.},

	completed both the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI),
	used to assess explanatory style (optimism-pessimism), and either
	the 12-Item or 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12 or SF-36),
	used to assess QOL. The MMPIs were completed an average of 13.4 years
	before the QOL assessment. The QOL measures were completed an average
	of 12.5 years after cancer diagnosis. Patients were divided into
	quartiles based on their MMPI Optimism-Pessimism scale score. Analysis
	was performed for all patients, those with head and neck cancer,
	and those with thyroid cancer. Adjustments were made for age, sex,
	and disease stage. RESULTS: For all 190 patients, optimism was associated
	with a higher QOL on both the mental and the physical component scales
	and 6 of 8 subscales of the SF-12 and SF-36. For patients with head
	and neck cancer, optimism was associated with higher QOL on 3 subscales

	Optimism was associated with a higher QOL in survivors of thyroid
	cancer compared with survivors of head and neck cancer. After adjusting
	for age, sex, and disease stage, optimism was not associated with

	exclusively on the effects of negative psychological conditions or
	emotional states. Little attention has been drawn to the impact associated
	with positive psychological conditions, which have been shown recently
	to have significant influences on neuroendocrine regulation. The
	aim of this study is to examine the impact of optimism and positive
	affect on salivary cortisol with the effects of their negative counterparts
	controlled for. DESIGN: Optimism and pessimism, and positive and
	negative affectivity were studied in relation to the diurnal rhythm
	of salivary cortisol in a group of 80 Hong Kong Chinese, who provided
	six saliva samples over the course of a day on two consecutive days.
	The separate effects of optimism and positive affect on two dynamic
	components of cortisol secretion, awakening response, and diurnal
	decline were examined. METHODS: Optimism and pessimism were measured
	using the Chinese version of the revised Life Orientation Test while
	generalized affects and mood states were assessed by the Chinese
	Affect Scale. An enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay kit (EIA) developed
	for use in saliva was adopted for the biochemical analysis of cortisol.
	Testing of major group differences associated with positive psychological
	conditions was carried out using two-way (group by saliva collection
	time) ANOVAs for repeated measures with negative psychological conditions
	and mood states as covariates. RESULTS: Participants having higher
	optimism scores exhibited less cortisol secretion in the awakening
	period when the effect of pessimism and mood were controlled. This
	effect was more apparent in men than in women who had higher cortisol
	levels in the awakening period. Optimism did not have similar effect
	on cortisol levels during the underlying period of diurnal decline.
	On the other hand, higher generalized positive affect was associated
	with lower cortisol levels during the underlying period of diurnal
	decline after the effects of negative affect and mood states had
	been controlled. Generalized positive affect did not significantly
	influence cortisol secretion during the awakening period. CONCLUSIONS:
	These findings suggest that positive psychological resources including
	optimism and generalized positive affect had higher impact on cortisol
	secretion than their negative counterparts, and point to the need
	for increased attention to the potential contribution of positive
	mental states to well-being.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: How breast cancer surgery affects social adjustment among
	Chinese women is unknown, as are factors predicting such adjustment.
	METHODS: 405 Chinese women receiving surgery for localized breast
	cancer completed Social Adjustment Scales (Ch-SAS) at 1-, 4- and
	8-months post-operatively. Subscale scores were regressed on baseline
	(days 3-12 post-operatively) measures of treatment decision-making
	difficulty (TDMD), self-efficacy (GSeS), consultation satisfaction
	(C-MISS-R), psychological (CHQ-12) and physical distress (PD), and
	1-month follow-up optimism (C-LOT-R), and disappointment (E-OI),
	fully adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: All
	Ch-SAS subscales except appearance & sexuality changed significantly
	over 8-months follow-up: Enjoyment of social activities (F=27.38,
	df 2, p<0.001) and self-image (F=3.63, df 2, p=0.027) improved slightly.
	Family interaction (F=26.63, df 2, p<0.001) and interaction with
	friends (F=3.37, df 2, p=0.035) declined slightly. Family and friends
	interaction subscales were predominantly predicted by high self-efficacy
	and optimism, whereas self-image and appearance & sexuality subscales
	were predominantly predicted by low treatment outcome disappointment,
	TDM difficulties, baseline psychological morbidity and high self-efficacy.
	Enjoyment of social activities was predicted by low baseline psychological
	distress and concurrent physical symptom distress. CONCLUSION: High
	self-efficacy and optimism predicted women who have better social
	relationships with friends and family. Higher self-efficacy, low
	TDM difficulties, less disappointment with treatment outcome and
	low psychological and physical distress predicted better adjustment
	to self-image and body image.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Between 30% and 70% of western women experience psychological
	morbidity after undergoing surgery for breast carcinoma; however,
	the rates and risk factors among Chinese women are unknown. Identifying
	at-risk women enables preventive intervention. METHODS: Among 430
	Chinese women who were approached within 1 week after undergoing
	surgery for early-stage breast carcinoma (baseline), 405 women (94%)
	completed measures of self-efficacy and psychological morbidity (the
	Chinese Health Questionnaire 12-item instrument [CHQ12]) and completed
	retrospective measures of treatment decision-making (TDM) difficulties,

	and treatment outcome expectations. One-month postsurgery follow-up
	(follow-up), CHQ12 scores for 367 of 405 women (91%) were adjusted
	for concurrent physical symptom distress and trait optimism (the
	revised Chinese Life Orientation Test) and baseline predictors using
	stepwise multivariate regression. RESULTS: At baseline 28% of women
	evidenced mild psychological morbidity, and 42% of women evidenced
	moderate-to-severe psychological morbidity: At follow-up, the respective
	rates were 32% and 36%. Preferred TDM involvement was associated
	with lower psychological morbidity (F = 6.702; P < 0.001). Baseline
	CHQ12 scores were predicted by outcome expectancies and TDM difficulties
	(adjusted regression coefficient [R(2)] = 0.192). Baseline CHQ12
	scores and follow-up chemotherapy, in turn, predicted physical symptom
	distress at follow-up. After adjustment, high physical symptom distress,
	baseline psychological morbidity, low optimism, and no chemotherapy
	independently predicted follow-up CHQ12 scores (adjusted R(2) = 0.585).
	CONCLUSIONS: Psychological morbidity was linked to women's TDM difficulties,
	their inability to anticipate treatment effects accurately, and physical
	symptom distress, possibly exacerbated by symptom misattribution.
	Optimizing TDM support and helping women accurately determine outcomes
	in terms of symptom experience and meaning and physical appearance
	may help to reduce psychological morbidity. Women who have TDM difficulties
	should be considered to be at high risk for psychological distress.},

	defined as remaining in the program for 90 days. There were 45 retainers
	and 39 rejecters in the study. The two groups were not significantly
	different with regard to ethnicity, age, or homelessness history.
	Intrinsic religiosity was measured with the Age Universal Intrinsic/Extrinsic

	Results: The eight SF-36 scales were feasible to administer and reliable.

	questionnaire study. METHODS: Eighty-two newly diagnosed patients
	with head and neck cancer (HNC) completed the Illness Perception
	Questionnaire--Revised (IPQ-R), the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire
	(BMQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Brief
	COPE and the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). Patient outcomes were
	assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment
	of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, MOS Short Form Health Survey (SF-12v2)

	cross-sectional results have shown that key components of the SRM
	(beliefs and coping) were explanatory factors of HR-QoL outcomes.
	The PGI was not associated with any of the components of the SRM.
	The PGI was partially correlated with HR-QoL measures; in particular,
	Global QoL/health status (EORTC) and Mental Component Summary scores
	(SF-12). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the illness perceptions
	approach may be a useful method for eliciting and understanding patients'
	beliefs regarding HNC. In order to maximize outcomes, simple interventions
	could address particular patient beliefs and coping styles.},

	utility of Leventhal's common sense model in predicting longitudinal
	judgement-based outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC).
	The study is of potential importance as it focuses on the relations
	between personality factors, coping styles, informational needs,
	illness representations, and outcomes using a longitudinal study
	design. This has particular value as the trend in similar research
	is to focus on concurrent relations between variables. In addition,
	the prediction of numerous outcomes from illness perceptions has
	received relatively scant attention in the field of HNC.Methods Fifty
	patients completed the following measures prior to treatment, 1 month
	and 6-8 months after treatment: IPQ-R, BMQ, Brief COPE, LOT-R, SCIP,
	EORTC QLQ-C30, SF-12, Patient Generated Index (PGI), and HADS.Results
	Baseline illness and treatment beliefs were not predictive of HR-QoL,
	individualized QoL, or anxiety 6-8 months after treatment; however,
	beliefs about the chronicity of the disease (timeline beliefs) were
	predictive of depression after treatment. Coping strategies employed
	and levels of satisfaction with information before treatment were
	significant predictors of several outcomes.Conclusions Our findings
	suggest that a common sense model may be a useful framework for eliciting
	and understanding patients' beliefs regarding HNC; however, there
	are concerns regarding the use of a [`]dynamic' model to predict
	longitudinal outcomes from baseline factors that may change over

	fears of recurrence manifestations of illness-related anxiety? (c)
	Are fears of recurrence closely related to current symptoms, disease,

	A prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample
	of 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age
	60 years) completed measures of fears of recurrence, illness perceptions,
	coping, and anxiety and depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months
	after treatment (fears of recurrence only).Results A third of HNC
	patients at diagnosis reported relatively high levels of fears of
	recurrence, with 12% still reporting similar levels of fear 6-8 months
	after treatment. Fears of recurrence were not related to any socio-demographic
	factor (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment)
	or disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors. Path analyses
	demonstrated that fears of cancer recurrence after treatment were
	directly predicted by pre-treatment fears and optimism.Conclusion

	For the quantitative data, individuals from five different provinces

	were designed to tap into their quality of life and their coping
	with prostate cancer. The psychological scales used in this study
	were: CES-D (depression scale); Duke University Religion Index (DUREL);
	Sense of Coherence (SOC); Life Orientation Test (LOT-R); The Brief

	individuals were attending a support group. Aspects that helped these
	individuals in coping with their prostate cancer were their religious/spiritual
	beliefs, support groups, family/friends, downward social comparisons,
	and their positive attitude. Multiple Regressions indicated that
	PTGI was positively associated with factors such as social/family

	seven studies (2000-2005) to measure effects of MBSR on health in
	patients with cancer were reviewed. Most studies used a one-group
	pro- and post-test design. The post-MBSR outcomes for each instrument

	pain, mindfulness, psychological acceptance, values-based action,

	demonstrated significant relations between the components of psychological
	flexibility and the measures of health and GP visits. In regression

	as potential predictors, psychological flexibility accounted for
	significant variance, &Delta;R <sup>2</sup> =.039-.40 (3.9-40.0%).
	In these regression equations pain intensity accounted for an average

	the impact of chronic pain in patients with low to moderately complex

	low and the generality of these results remains to be established.

	was to determine whether a series of expressive writing exercises
	incorporating specific mental simulation techniques focused on academic
	performance would result in academic benefits. Participants in the
	study were 47 undergraduate students at an Oklahoma university recruited
	from a single freshman Chemistry course. The study used Web-based
	data collection methods designed by the researcher. Participants
	completed pre- and post-intervention administrations of the Life
	Orientation Test Scale (LOT-R) and the Self-Efficacy for Self-Regulated
	Learning Scale (SE-SRL). The intervention consisted of four days
	of mental simulation exercises in an expressive writing context.
	Participants were randomly assigned to one of three writing conditions:
	(1) a writing intervention incorporating process-based mental simulation
	techniques in which participants were given explicit instructions
	to visualize themselves formulating plans and developing methods
	to improve academic performance, (2) a writing intervention incorporating
	outcome-based mental simulation techniques in which participants
	were instructed to visualize academic success, and (3) a control
	condition. Academic performance was operationalized as semester grades
	for the Chemistry course, and these grades were used as the dependent
	variable. Analyses of variance (ANOVA), multiple regression, and
	Chi-square tests were used to investigate six research questions.
	Findings and conclusions. The study did not find any significant
	differences in measures of academic performance based on the mental
	simulation/expressive writing exercises. A significant moderating
	effect was found for self-efficacy on academic performance, such
	that higher levels of self-efficacy were associated with higher semester
	grades. A number of possible factors that impacted the results of
	the present study, including a high rate of attrition, and the fact
	that data collection was Web-based instead of the traditional paper
	and pencil method, were explored. Additionally, implications for
	future research were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009

  abstract = {Research suggests that benefits accrue to those who are optimistic,
	but is optimism an important component of human personality? The
	five-factor model of personality, a widely recognized and purportedly
	comprehensive taxonomy of significant personality traits, relegates
	optimism to a mere descriptor of the Positive Emotions (E6) facet
	of Extraversion in lieu of the more central importance to personality
	that optimism researchers ascribe to it. This dichotomy was considered.
	Relationships among optimism, coping, health behavior, and personality
	were investigated as well. Compared to pessimists, optimists in general
	were predicted to use more direct coping processes when confronted
	with stressful situations, engage in a larger number of positive
	health practices, and be more extraverted, agreeable, and emotionally
	stable. The Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ), the Life Orientation
	Test-Revised (LOT-R), the Trait Optimism Measure (TOM), the State
	Optimism Measure (SOM), the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R,
	Form S), the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ), the Health Behavior
	Survey (HBS), and a brief demographic information sheet were administered
	to a sample of 414 undergraduate university students. The ASQ and
	the LOT-R are widely used measures of optimism. The researcher developed
	the TOM and SOM, single-item measures of optimism, for use in this
	study. The NEO-PI-R assesses the five-factor model of personality.
	The WCQ generates scores on coping processes. Pearson correlations,
	t tests and confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were used
	for statistical analysis. Consistent with the literature, no significant
	gender effect was found on any of the optimism measures. As expected,
	women reported healthier behavior than did men on the Health Practices
	Index of the HBS. Congruent with previous research, significant gender
	differences were found on one of the eight coping scales, i.e., women
	scored significantly higher on Seeking Social Support. Exploratory
	factor analysis of the NEO PI-R clearly revealed the expected five
	factors. Cross-loadings were similar between the normative and study
	samples. The study sample produced more pronounced gender differences
	and higher overall means. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated
	that the optimism measures loaded on a factor separate from any of
	the Extraversion facets, including Positive Emotions (E6). Results
	suggest that the NEO PI-R does not assess optimism as an aspect of
	extraversion, and that optimism is strongly associated with low neuroticism.
	Alternative explanations and implications are discussed. (PsycINFO

  abstract = {This study was based on the investigation of the relationship between
	Cass's (1996) model of gay identity development and concepts theorized
	to be positive character traits: hope, optimism, and life engagement.
	A survey-based design was used to assess whether people would differ
	statistically in terms of their hope, optimism, and life engagement
	based on their level of gay identity development. Gay identity development
	was measured with the Gay Identity Questionnaire (Brady & Busse,
	1994); hope with the Hope Scale (Snyder et al., 1991); optimism with
	the Life Orientation Test - Revised (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges,
	1994); and life engagement with the Life Engagement Test (Scheier,
	2006). The construct of internalized homo-negativity was also assessed
	in order to control for it statistically and was measured with the
	Internalized Homo-Negativity Sub-Scale of the Lesbian and Gay Identity
	Scale (Mohr & Fassinger, 2000). A total of 77 participants' data
	were used to conduct a MANCOVA and a logistic regression analysis.
	Results from the MANCOVA indicate that participants did differ in
	their levels of the dependent variables according to their level
	of gay identity development. Post-hoc tests revealed that each dependent
	variable contributed a unique effect to the multivariate difference
	in participant groups and that the combination of scores on dependent
	variables reliably distinguished participants according to level
	of gay identity development. This indicates that the dependent variables
	may be aspects of a super-ordinate construct. Of these concepts,
	only hope was found to reliably predict whether participants would
	be in the highest phase of Cass's model or if they would be in the
	lower phases. The findings of the present study offer support for
	the notion that hopefulness, optimism, and life engagement are important
	to explore when clients present as struggling with issues related
	to same-sex sexuality. Cass's model (1996) is helpful for identifying
	individuals in high-functioning levels of gay identity development.
	The findings need to be replicated in other groups of same-sex sexual
	people in order to be generalizable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

	quality of life compare across cultures. METHODS: Three samples of
	pregnant women in their final trimester were recruited from China,
	Ghana, and the United States (U.S.). Participants completed a survey
	that included the Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R, an optimism/pessimism
	measure), the Short Form 12 (SF-12, a quality of life measure), and
	questions addressing health and demographic factors. A three-country
	set was created for analysis by matching women on age, gestational
	age at enrollment, and number of previous pregnancies. Anovas with
	post-hoc pairwise comparisons were used to compare results across
	the cohorts. Multivariate regression analysis was used to create
	a model to identify those variables most strongly associated with
	optimism/pessimism. RESULTS: LOT-R scores varied significantly across
	cultures in these samples, with Ghanaian pregnant women being the
	most optimistic and least pessimistic and Chinese pregnant women
	being the least optimistic overall and the least pessimistic in subscale
	analysis. Four key variables predicted approximately 20% of the variance
	in overall optimism scores: country of origin (p = .006), working
	for money (p = .05); level of education (p = .002), and ever being
	treated for emotional issues with medication (p < .001). Quality
	of life scores also varied by country in these samples, with the
	most pronounced difference occurring in the vitality measure. U.S.
	pregnant women reported far lower vitality scores than both Chinese
	and Ghanaian pregnant women in our sample. CONCLUSION: This research
	raises important questions regarding what it is about country of
	origin that so strongly influences optimism/pessimism among pregnant
	women. Further research is warranted exploring underlying conceptualization
	of optimism/pessimism and health related quality of life across countries.},

	The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of a mindfulness-based

	quality of life in those with COPD. Design: We conducted a randomized
	controlled trial of 8-week mindfulness-based breathing therapy (MBBT)
	compared to support groups to test efficacy on improving symptoms
	and health-related quality of life in those with COPD. Setting: The
	setting for this study was an academic-affiliated veterans healthcare
	system. Subjects: The subjects consisted of 86 patients with COPD.
	Interventions: MBBT included weekly meetings practicing mindfulness
	mediation and relaxation response. Outcome measures: The main outcome
	measure was a post 6-minute-walk test (6MWT) Borg dyspnea assessment.
	Other outcome measures included health-related quality of life measures,
	6MWT distance, symptom scores, exacerbation rates, and measures of
	stress and mindfulness. Analysis of covariance compared differences
	in outcomes between groups; paired t test evaluated changes within
	groups. Results: Participants were predominantly elderly men with
	moderate to severe COPD. We found no improvements in dyspnea (post
	6MWT Borg difference between the MBBT and support group was 0.3 (95%
	confidence interval [CI]: &minus;1.1, 1.7). We found no differences
	between groups in almost all other outcome measures by either intention-to-treat
	analysis or within the subset that completed assigned group sessions.
	For the physical summary scale of the generic Short Form-36 for Veterans,
	the difference between outcomes favored the support group (4.3, 95%
	CI: 0.4, 8.1). Participant retention was low compared to mind-body
	trials that randomize from CAM wait lists. Conclusions: This trial
	found no measurable improvements in patients with COPD receiving
	a mindfulness-based breathing CAM therapy compared to a support group,
	suggesting that this intervention is unlikely to be an important
	therapeutic option for those with moderate-to-severe COPD. [ABSTRACT

  year = {1999},
  abstract = {This study explored the stress and coping of college seniors in the
	semester prior to graduation. Schlossberg, Waters, and Goodman's
	(1995) model of adaptation to life change and the Lazarus and Folkman
	(1984) transactional model of stress and coping were used as the
	theoretical foundation of this study. Two primary goals were (a)
	to apply the theoretical models specifically to college graduation,
	and (b) to determine if an intervention designed to facilitate adaptation
	to transition could benefit college seniors. Secondary goals included
	the examination of optimism and gender on stress and coping. Thirty-five
	undergraduate seniors, randomly assigned to treatment or waiting-list
	control groups, were administered a pre-test and three follow-up
	surveys over the course of the semester. Measures included the Stress
	Appraisal Measure (Peacock & Wong, 1990), COPE (Carver, Scheier,
	& Weintraub, 1989), and Life Orientation Test-Revised (Scheier, Carver,
	& Bridges, 1994). A graduation checklist was developed and validated
	for this study. The single-session, small-group intervention was
	cognitive-behavioral and informed by Seligman's (1998) Learned Optimism.
	Hypotheses focused on appraisal of graduation and corresponding coping
	strategies. The results indicated general support for Lazarus and
	Folkman's (1984) model, primary appraisal of graduation as a challenge
	was significantly related to use of active coping; secondary appraisal
	of graduation as controllable by others was significantly related
	to avoidance coping. Seniors who appraised graduation as uncontrollable
	tended to use reframing as a coping strategy. Optimism was significantly
	related to appraisals of individual control and a challenge. The
	intervention failed to have discernable effects on appraisal and
	coping, however differential effects were found in secondary analyses
	accounting for the imminence of graduation. Students with more time
	to prepare for graduation appeared to gain greater benefits from
	the intervention by increasing appraisal of challenge and decreasing
	appraisal of transition as uncontrollable and decreasing avoidance
	coping. No gender effects were found. Kirkpatrick's (1994) model
	was used to examine workshop process. The intervention failed to
	conform to the model, with participant satisfaction being unrelated
	to knowledge or learning outcomes. Conclusions on student perception
	of control in coping with graduation are discussed along with recommendations
	for counseling and intervention development. (PsycINFO Database Record

	data questionnaire. In addition, relevant injury-related data was

	levels of depression were experienced in the study sample, while
	hope and dispositional optimism were significantly lower in comparison
	to the general population. The correlation patterns indicate that
	both hope and dispositional optimism negatively correlated with participants'
	depression levels and that they showed significant positive correlations
	with each other. In the case of mild depression, the hope-Pathways
	sub-scale of the AHS was the only variable negatively correlated
	to it, while in moderate-to-severe depression all coping variables
	were negatively correlated to it. Regression analysis revealed that
	the AHS and LOT-R, but not the demographic and injury-related variables,

  abstract = {Western health professions are trying to become more effective in
	helping patients to manage chronic pain and, as a result, are looking
	to complementary and alternative methods, often originating from
	the east (Asia). The physiotherapy profession, however, appears to
	be at a critical juncture in its development, whereby incorporation
	of too much holistic treatment may destabilise 'the body as a machine'
	concept, a concept that has long been the profession's major basis
	for its rationale for treatment. Yet, a large amount of recent literature
	has warranted the need for physiotherapists dealing with chronic
	pain, to understand the psyche as unseparate from the soma in order
	for treatment to provide a lasting effect. Such understanding puts
	large emphasis on physiotherapeutic intervention being placebo- or
	nocebo-based, thus implying that intervention will often become a
	necessity in order to tolerate pain, or, become a conduit that exacerbates
	the pain. This is supported by evidence indicating that both modality
	intervention and psychological intervention are one of the key inhibitors
	to those with long-term chronic pain effectively managing their condition
	independently. Body-mindfulness practice, stemming from an ancient
	Indian form of meditation, is a process adopted recently by behavioural
	therapists in the West to ease psychological disorders. It claims
	to bridge the intervention conundrum in those suffering with long-term
	chronic pain. Body-mindfulness practice might, therefore, prove useful
	as a self-empowerment process in addition to being an antidote to
	dependence or exacerbation from physiotherapy treatment intervention.
	The physiotherapy profession has been looking for ways to merge the
	conceptual understanding of the 'body as a machine' with holism and
	is keen to do this without sacrificing its highly regarded professional
	status. Body-mindfulness practice appears to be a middle road that
	blends unreactive awareness to the grounded reality of arising physical
	sensations, healing the Cartesian split of the psyche from the soma.
	In addition, physiotherapists appear to be well suited professionals
	for guiding body-mindfulness practice due to their ability in assessing
	the fundamental aspects required for the process to unfold. [ABSTRACT

	scales. Physical and mental health status was measured with the SF-12.
	RESULTS: The study completion rate was 76.7%. At week 8, the massage
	group had average difference scores for pain unpleasantness of 2.9

	sites. Rehabilitation data were collected from the beginning, middle,

	and post-stress test data were collected, when available and analyzed
	in within-subjects design. MLR models were used to test the relationship
	of each approach to predict outcomes independently and over and above
	the other approach. Interactions between collection sites and the
	predictors demonstrated the importance of running interactions, replication
	across sites, and examining subsamples within a population. Results
	show the LOT-R was significantly correlated with compliance, body
	mass index, heart rate, and diastolic blood pressure, while the ASQ
	was not correlated with any criterion variables. Compliance was also
	significantly related to sex. MLR results show that the ASQ accounted

	about Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and demonstrate its
	usefulness for reducing stress in a variety of populations. Data
	Sources: A literature review was conducted using the following databases:
	EBSCO, Cinahl, Pschyline, and Medline. English language articles
	published between 2000 and 2006 in peer-reviewed journals were reviewed.
	Search terms "mindfulness,""meditation," and "stress" were used.
	Additional information was obtained through select, reputable Internet
	sites. Conclusions: MBSR is an effective treatment for reducing stress
	and anxiety that accompanies daily life and chronic illness. MBSR
	is also therapeutic for healthcare providers, enhancing their interactions
	with patients. No negative side effects from MBSR have been documented.
	Implications for practice: MBSR is a safe, effective, integrative
	approach for reducing stress. Patients and healthcare providers experiencing
	stress or stress-related symptoms benefit from MBSR programs. NPs
	can safely and effectively use this intervention in a variety of
	patient populations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	by social desirability: impression management, one of two components
	of socially desirable responding, correlates significantly with the
	method factor whereas the other component, self-deceptive enhancement,
	is related to the general optimism factor. Thus it is shown that

  abstract = {Since 1990, over 50,000 children have been adopted from Eastern European
	orphanages. The research indicates that the majority of these children,
	despite early exposure to sub-optimal conditions for healthy growth
	and development, thrive once placed in families. Yet, very little
	is known about characteristics of the post-adoption environment that
	ameliorate risk factors and foster resilience. This study, based
	on positive psychological models of functioning, was intended to
	assess possible relations between adoptive parents' levels of hope,
	optimism, and positive illusions, factors that have been shown to
	influence both mental and physical health, and their children's resilience.
	The sample was composed of 79 parents who had adopted children from
	Russian orphanages. Their children had spent between 1 and 3 years
	in an orphanage, and had been living with their adoptive families
	for a time equal to or greater than the time spent in an institution.
	Parents completed the Hope Scale, the Life Orientation Test---Revised,
	a brief measure of positive illusions and realistic acceptance, and
	reported on their children's current functioning. The positive illusions/realistic
	acceptance instrument did not have acceptable internal reliability
	and was not used in the main analyses. Parent participants evidenced
	levels of hope, optimism, and realistic acceptance higher than those
	previously reported in other studies. No significant correlations
	were found between parents' levels of hope, optimism, or realistic
	acceptance and the severity of their child's disability, operationalized
	as hours of therapy received weekly. The children's range of functioning
	corresponded to that of the general population on the Vineland Adaptive
	Behavior Scales (M = 101.87, SD = 16.29). This demonstration of competence
	offered additional evidence for the population's resilience. Multiple
	regression analysis found that parental hope was not a significant
	predictor of adaptive functioning. However, parental optimism accounted
	for a modest but significant amount of the variance in children's
	adaptive functioning over and above that accounted for by severity
	of disability. Contrary to previous studies, neither age at adoption
	nor length of time in an institution was a significant predictor
	of post-adoption adaptive functioning. Implications for positive

	research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all

	Additionally, the malleability of these attitudes when confronted

	selves paradigm (Markus, H. & Nurius, P., 1986) was used as the overarching
	framework upon which to base this examination. An infertility manipulation
	which consisted of a videotaped role-play of a physician telling
	participants that there was a problem with their fertility, was utilized
	for the treatment group. Controls viewed the same physician on tape
	explaining that there appeared to be no problem with their fertility.
	Gender, sex-role orientation as assessed with the Bem Sex-Role Inventory,
	and possible selves for parenting as assessed by the Possible Selves
	Inventory were used for comparisons. The Parenting Questionnaire,
	which was developed for this study, was utilized to assess parenting
	salience and openness to assisted fertility and adoption. Optimism,

	a possible moderator of the infertility treatment. Data did not support
	the hypothesis that gender predicted parenting salience. Sex-role
	orientation was however a significant predictor of parenting salience,

	parenting more important than masculine males. Androgynous respondents
	(60% of the sample) fell in between the aforementioned categories.

	capabilities. The moderating function of optimism on the study's

	quality of life (HRQoL), and psychological symptoms during an 8-week
	mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program among groups of
	participants with different chronic pain conditions. Methods: From
	1997-2003, a longitudinal investigation of chronic pain patients
	(n=133) was nested within a larger prospective cohort study of heterogeneous
	patients participating in MBSR at a university-based Integrative
	Medicine center. Measures included the Short-Form 36 Health Survey
	and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Paired t tests were used to compare
	pre-post changes on outcome measures. Differences in treatment effect
	sizes were compared as a function of chronic pain condition. Correlations
	were examined between outcome parameters and home meditation practice.
	Results: Outcomes differed in significance and magnitude across common
	chronic pain conditions. Diagnostic subgroups of patients with arthritis,
	back/neck pain, or two or more comorbid pain conditions demonstrated
	a significant change in pain intensity and functional limitations
	due to pain following MBSR. Participants with arthritis showed the
	largest treatment effects for HRQoL and psychological distress. Patients
	with chronic headache/migraine experienced the smallest improvement
	in pain and HRQoL. Patients with fibromyalgia had the smallest improvement
	in psychological distress. Greater home meditation practice was associated
	with improvement on several outcome measures, including overall psychological
	distress, somatization symptoms, and self-rated health, but not pain
	and other quality of life scales. Conclusion: MBSR treatment effects
	on pain, HRQoL and psychological well-being vary as a function of
	chronic pain condition and compliance with home meditation practice.

  title = {Dispositional optimism, fatalism, and quality of life in Latino cancer
	patients},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {The impact of dispositional optimism and fatalism on quality of life
	(QoL) domains in cancer patient populations has been extensively
	studied in the health literature. Optimism has been shown to be associated
	with better QoL and active coping strategies; however, few studies
	have investigated these relationships in Latino cancer patient populations.
	Furthermore, although fatalism has been extensively studied in Latino
	populations in regards to lower cancer screening practices, avoidant
	coping, and psychological distress, few studies have investigated
	the relationship between fatalism, acculturation, and QoL. Optimism,
	fatalism, acculturation, coping responses, and QoL outcomes were
	examined in 105 Latino cancer patients (40 men and 65 women) with
	solid tumor diagnoses. The Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R;
	Scheier et al., 1994) was utilized to measure optimism. Powerful
	Others (PHLC) and Chance (CHLC) subscales of the Multidimensional
	Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLC; Wallston & Wallston, 1978) and
	the Powe Fatalism Inventory (PFI; Powe, 1995) were used to measure
	dimensions of fatalism. Coping responses were assessed with the Brief
	Cope (Carver, 1997), and an adapted version of the Acculturation
	Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA-II; Cuellar, Arnold, &
	Maldonado, 1995) was used to determine the acculturation status of
	the participants. Results indicated that optimism and acculturation
	were positively correlated with QoL, and optimism proved to have
	a significant and positive mediating effect on the relationship of
	acculturation status and QoL. Optimistic Latino cancer patients tended
	to utilize active coping, planning, and acceptance strategies, but
	only active coping and acceptance were related to higher QoL scores.
	Pessimistic patients used more avoidant coping strategies (denial,
	venting, substance use, and behavioral disengagement), which were
	significantly related to lower QoL scores. Higher levels of fatalism
	and less acculturation were also associated with lower QoL scores.
	Patients who reported higher levels of cancer fear tended to use
	more denial coping. All the avoidant coping responses were associated
	with CHLC; only substance use was related to PHLC. Clinical assessment
	of these study variables in Latino patient populations may help identify
	individuals at risk for adjustment problems following a cancer diagnosis.

	Optimism and pessimism are associated with cardiovascular disease
	mortality and progression; however, the biological mechanism remains
	unclear. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the Multi-Ethnic
	Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a study of 6814 persons aged 45
	to 84 years with no history of clinical cardiovascular disease. The
	Life-Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) was used to measure dispositional
	optimism and pessimism. Regression analyses were used to estimate
	associations of optimism and pessimism with interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive
	protein (CRP), fibrinogen, homocysteine, Factor VIII, D-dimer, and
	plasmin-antiplasmin, before and after adjustment for sociodemographics,
	depression, cynicism, health behaviors, body mass index (BMI), hypertension,
	and diabetes. RESULTS: Higher scores on the LOT-R (positive disposition)
	were related to lower concentrations of IL-6 (p = .001), fibrinogen
	(p < .001), and homocysteine (p = .031). Associations were stronger
	for the pessimism subscale. After adjustment for demographics, the
	percentage differences in inflammatory markers corresponding to a
	2-standard deviation increase in pessimism were 6.01% (p = .001)
	for IL-6, 10.31% (p = .001) for CRP, 2.47% (p < .0001) for fibrinogen,
	and 1.36% (p = .07) for homocysteine. Associations were attenuated
	but significant after adjustment for sociodemographics, depression,
	cynical distrust, and behaviors. Further adjustment for hypertension,
	BMI, and diabetes reduced associations for CRP and IL-6. Pessimism
	remained associated with a 1.36% (p = .02) increase in fibrinogen
	in the fully adjusted model. Factor VIII, D-dimer, and plasmin-antiplasmin
	were not associated with the LOT-R or subscales. CONCLUSIONS: Pessimism
	is related to higher levels of inflammation. Health behaviors, BMI,
	hypertension, and diabetes seem to play a mediating role.},

	test and validate a new measure, Reactions to Everyday Dilemmas (RED),
	which estimates an individual's stage of "meaning-making" as defined
	by Kegan's (1982, 1994) constructive-developmental theory of personality.
	According to Kegan, individuals progress through a series of hierarchically
	ordered stages during which their frameworks for interpreting experiences
	become increasingly complex. As people advance from one stage to
	the next, a more encompassing meaning-making framework influences
	how they react to complex situations at work, school, and in their
	personal lives. The present paper describes two studies to establish
	RED's reliability and construct validity. RED was compared with scores
	from the Defining Issues Test (DIT) (Rest, 1975, 1979) to establish
	convergent validity, and the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) (Scheier,
	Weintraub, & Carver, 1986; Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994) to assess
	discriminant validity. Modest significant correlations were observed
	between several of RED's stage scales and those of the DIT, even
	after controlling for the covariates of age and education. Two of
	RED's scales also correlated with the LOT-R. The LOT-R unexpectedly
	correlated with age and educational level, and the relationship between
	RED and the LOT-R decreased substantially after controlling for these
	two variables. Suggestions for future revisions of the RED and research
	steps are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to examine the relationships among optimism,
	appraisal, coping strategies, and psychosocial adjustment while situational
	factors of age, marital status, education, perception of financial
	ability, institutions, time since diagnosis and perceived social
	support were statistically controlled. A convenience sample of 129
	Thai women newly diagnosed with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy
	was obtained from three hospitals located in Bangkok, Thailand. Optimism,
	appraisal, coping strategies, and psychosocial adjustment were assessed
	with the Life Orientation Test-Revised, the Appraisal Questionnaire,
	the Ways of Coping Checklist, and the Psychosocial Adjustment to
	Illness Scale-Self Report, respectively. The majority of Thai women
	newly diagnosed with breast cancer were optimistic, and they appraised
	their situation almost equally as "harm," "challenge," and "threat."
	These women used problem-focused coping strategies more often than
	emotion focused coping strategies. Psychosocial adjustment was moderately
	related to age, marital status, education, time since diagnosis,
	harm/loss appraisal, threat appraisal, and emotion-focused coping.
	No relationships were found between optimism and overall psychosocial
	adjustment, problem-focused coping strategies and overall psychosocial
	adjustment, and perceived social support and overall psychosocial
	adjustment. There was a positively significant correlation between
	optimism and problem-focused coping, as well as optimism and health
	care orientation adjustment. Hierarchical multiple regression showed
	that marital status, perception of financial ability, time since
	diagnosis, and threat appraisal explained twenty-six percent of the
	variance in overall psychosocial adjustment. Age, perception of financial
	ability, hospital sites, and optimism explained twenty-four percent
	of variance in health care orientation adjustment. Age, time since
	diagnosis, and threat appraisal explained thirty percent of the variance
	in domestic environment adjustment. There were no statistically significant
	relationships between the predictors and adjustment in extended family
	relationships, social environment, and vocational environment. These
	findings provide partial support for the stress and coping theory
	of Lazarus and Folkman (1984). The findings also provide an understanding
	of the important role of appraisal in the adjustment of Thai women
	with breast cancer. Implications for nursing practice are that nurses
	may need to evaluate the patients' appraisals of their situation
	and their perceptions of financial ability as a routine part of care.

  abstract = {This study examined how self-reports of individuals' exposure (physical
	and emotional) to the World Trade Center Disaster and the personality
	variable of Dispositional Optimism (DO) were related to their perceptions
	of growth as a result of the event. In addition, the study also addressed
	adaptive coping strategies as mediating variables between optimism,
	exposure and growth. Data collection began five months after September
	11, 2001. Information was collected from an online survey that included
	a Demographic Survey, an Exposure Questionnaire (EQ), the NEO Five
	Factor Inventory (NEO-I), the Stress-Related Growth Scale (SRGS-R),
	the Life Orientation Tests-Revised (LOT-R), and the Cope Questionnaire
	(COPE). The sample consisted of 274 undergraduate students from New
	York City and Pleasantville campuses of Pace University. Multiple
	regression analyses were used to examine the relationships among
	degree of exposure, DO, adaptive coping strategies and self-reported
	growth. Results indicated that DO and adaptive coping strategies
	significantly predicted self-reported growth in the positive direction
	and that physical exposure also predicted specific areas of self-reported
	growth, but in the negative direction. Emotional exposure did not
	predict growth. Some evidence was found for the mediating role of
	coping in the optimism-growth and exposure-growth relationships.
	An important implication of this study is that those individuals
	who tend to see negative events in a positive light and who use adaptive
	coping strategies report more growth from a negative life event compared
	to those who were not optimistic and did not use such coping strategies.
	Therefore in developing therapeutic interventions, it may be important
	to consider ways to help individuals view a negative life event from
	a more optimistic viewpoint and implement adaptive coping strategies.
	Interventions could focus on the issue of religion and spirituality,
	increasing the repertoire of problem solving and support seeking
	skills and the cognitive reinterpretation of negative life experiences
	in positive ways, in an effort to facilitate perceived growth. Enhancing
	these coping strategies might facilitate successful integration of
	the negative experience, thereby allowing the individual to move
	on with their life and prevent the development of pathological responses
	to trauma. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

	of a new therapy manual for group interventions, 'Mindfulness-based
	Cognitive Therapy for Depression' (MBCT), appears to be one of the
	first major developments in this direction. MBCT represents an adaptation
	of the mindfulness meditation approach into a group programme for
	relapse prevention of depression. This paper links the mindfulness
	approach into current metacognitive concepts and models of emotional
	disorders by firstly exploring the limitations of Beck's schema theory
	and then describing a more recent multilevel model (interacting cognitive
	sub-systems, or ICS) which represents the theoretical foundation
	for the mindfulness approach. A description of the MBCT manual is
	followed by looking at the methodological limitations of the mindfulness
	construct and its implications for future therapeutic interventions.
	Despite its methodological problems, MBCT appears to be an advanced
	and cost-efficient approach to prophylactic interventions to prevent
	recovered depressed patients from relapse. Further developments and
	methodological testing is still required to give the approach an
	even more robust foundation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the role of the health care professional in
	creating an optimal healing environment (OHE), with a special focus
	on which inner state and way of being in the world can create a healing
	intention. A core thesis is that every healing effort and every healing
	intention starts within the health care professional. An accepting,
	mindful, and warm-hearted relationship with self is primary to any
	healing intention. Important concepts to develop such an attitude
	are mindfulness, love, compassion, and awareness. The concept of
	a healing attitude toward the self is described, as is the mirror
	principle that states there is symmetry between some- one's relationship
	with the outer world and his or her inner world. The mindfulness
	concept is outlined through a set of mental and heart qualities.
	Mindfulness is strongly related to compassion, and it is compassion
	that serves as a source for all healing intentionality. Compassion
	connects the suffering of the patient with the healer' s own suffering,
	and this emotional connection instantiates a healing relationship.
	The power and importance of mindfulness and compassion for healing
	are explored along the Frank model of nonspecific therapeutic components.
	This is the approach whereby a health care professional can elicit
	self-healing powers in patients through his or her inner attitudes.
	Finally, a research program and some hypotheses on how to implement
	and research this specific approach toward the creation of an OHE
	are outlined. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	to Cancer (MAC) Scale, as a measure for coping, a VAS for appraisal
	and the EORTC QLQ-C30, as a measure for QOL at two time points: at
	diagnosis and 12-months after breast cancer surgery. Optimism-pessimism
	had both a direct and indirect influence on QOL. Two coping strategies
	were particularly strong mediators for the indirect influence: fighting
	spirit and hopeless/helpless. Optimists responded with fighting spirit,
	which had a positive effect on their QOL. On the other hand, pessimists
	responded with hopeless/ helplessness, which had a negative effect
	on their QOL. The relationship between pessimism and QOL at time
	of diagnosis was also mediated by appraisal, such as threat. The
	two coping strategies remained fairly stable over the 12 months within
	the optimists and pessimists. The results suggest that the influence
	of optimism and pessimism on QOL appears to be mediated by coping
	both before and after treatment for breast cancer. Fighting spirit
	and hopeless/helplessness appear to reflect the characteristic coping
	strategies for optimists and pessimists. (PsycINFO Database Record

	determine the ability of those factors to predict distress levels.
	The sample consisted of 126 women recruited from RESOLVE, a support
	group for infertile individuals. Survey packets were sent and returned
	by mail. Psychological distress was measured with the Brief Symptom
	Inventory. Cognitive appraisals were assessed with the Stress Appraisal
	Measure. Optimism orientation was assessed with the Life Orientation
	Test-Revised, and time in treatment was based on self-report. Results
	indicated that participants experienced a high level of distress
	overall. Distress varied across years in treatment, with the greatest
	amount of distress reported by those in the middle years. Threat,
	defined as the perception of potential harm or loss from the situation,
	varied across years in treatment in a way that was similar to that
	of distress. Both optimism orientation and threat were significantly
	correlated to and were predictive of distress. Optimism was negatively
	correlated with distress and threat was positively correlated with
	distress. No relation between age and distress was found. Breakdown

	the perception of having personal control over the situation is beneficial

	consisting of two subscales that each assess one of the conceptualizations),
	the Proactive Competence Scale (PCS; that assesses the proactive

	that conceptualizing proactive coping as a positively-focused striving
	for goals was predictive of well-being (the shared variance from
	affect, subjective well-being and physical symptoms), whereas conceptualizing
	proactive coping as focused on preventing a negative future was not.
	The first conceptualization of proactive coping's unique association
	with well-being was explained by two of the proactive competencies,
	use of resources and realistic goal setting, and the remaining variance
	in well-being was explained by the first factor of optimism. These
	results demonstrated that aspiring for a positive future is distinctly

	general practice lists. Optimism and health behaviours were assessed
	by questionnaire, and healthy ageing indexed by physical health summary
	scores from the Short Form 36, and by self-rated health. Results.
	Optimism was associated with not smoking, moderate alcohol consumption,
	brisk walking, and vigorous physical activities (women only), independently
	of socio-demographic factors and clinical condition. Physical health
	status was associated with optimism, independently of socio-demographic
	factors, clinical condition, negative affectivity, and body mass.
	This effect was attenuated when health behaviours were taken into
	account. Self-rated health was also positively related to optimism,
	and this association was not mediated by health behaviours. Neither
	the optimism nor pessimism subscales of the Life Orientation Test
	showed as consistent effects as the full scale. Conclusions. We conclude

	no significant differences in weight loss or mental health. However,
	when intervention participants who reported 'never' applying the
	workshop principles at 6 months (n =7) were excluded, results showed
	both significantly greater increases in physical activity (3.1 sessions
	per week relative to controls, p <.05) and significantly greater
	reductions in BMI (0.96 relative to controls, equivalent to 2.32kg,
	p <0.5). Reductions in BMI were mediated primarily by reductions
	in binge eating. Despite its brevity, the intervention was successful
	at bringing about change. Further refinements should increase its

	Psychosocial distress contributes to adolescent injuries, homicide

	resilience allows at-risk individuals to avoid distress, successfully
	cope and function better than expected. Empirical studies with at-risk
	rural adolescents have been sparse. The specific aims were to: (1)
	identify the point prevalence and levels of psychosocial resilience;
	(2) propose and test a theoretical model of psychosocial resilience;
	and (3) explore the gender and age differences. Lazarus' Theory of
	Stress and Coping and Lerner's Developmental Contextualism was used
	to form the theoretical framework. This secondary analysis used a
	cross-sectional sample of 624 rural adolescents from four rural schools
	in western Pennsylvania. All instruments demonstrated good reliability
	and validity. The instruments included Life Event Checklist, Life
	Orientation Test-Revised, Perceived Social Support Scale, Coping

	p = .0018, and final-year non-athletes, F(1,99) = 6.904, p = .0100.
	No significant difference was found between both first-year athletes
	and non-athletes and between first-year and final-year non-athletes.
	These results provide support that a possible relationship does exist
	between athletic participation, year, and optimism levels. The reasons
	provided for these significant differences may be due to increases
	in self-efficacy and mastery challenges provided by athletic participation.

	between different levels of injury severity. IDI scales and subscales
	correlated highly and in a convergent pattern with validity measures
	of posttraumatic stress (r range, .18-.50), depression (r range,

	as well as theoretically related variables, such as general distress
	(r range, .32-.56), self-efficacy (r range, -.15 to -.39), and optimism
	(r range, -.21 to -.45). IDI scales correlated in a discriminant
	pattern with measures of drug and alcohol abuse (r range, .02-.07;

  year = {2002},
  abstract = {The goal of this study was to assess the impact of two psychosocial
	interventions, a meditation group and a supportive therapy group,
	on positive coping in cancer patients. Participants were recruited
	from a large cancer specialty hospital in NYC. All patients completed
	the Life Orientation Test, Revised (LOT-R), measuring optimism, and
	a coping skills inventory (COPE), and provided qualitative data describing
	their intervention experience. Positive and negative coping indices
	were aggregated from the COPE subscales. Positive coping included
	acceptance plus positive refraining and negative coping included
	denial plus behavioral disengagement. The interaction of optimism
	and group participation was evaluated to determine if group participation
	moderated coping choices. Both interventions were led by two healthcare
	professionals trained in the specific treatment interventions. Meditation
	group facilitators had prior personal experience with the use of
	meditation. The interventions were conducted two hours each week
	for 7 weeks. The meditation group used a Western form of meditation.
	The supportive therapy group used a Rogerian orientation. Of the
	twenty-six (26) patients, heterogeneous with respect to cancer type
	and stage, who completed the intervention, 15 were randomized to
	the meditation group and 11 to the supportive therapy group. Meditation
	group participant scores in optimism and positive coping increased
	and negative coping decreased after the intervention. Scores for
	the supportive therapy group participants did not change. Although
	this study failed to confirm the existence of a moderation effect,
	a significant main effect for group participation emerged. Qualitative
	data is presented that supports these findings. These results are
	consistent with current theory that meditation groups are effective
	because they rely on the individual's own resources to define their
	optimal coping strategies. This leads to a more satisfying way of
	life. Future studies are necessary to confirm these results in a
	larger sample and different populations. Results could lead to putting
	interventions in place to support the chronically and terminally
	ill patients and their caregivers. The effectiveness of meditation
	groups to enhance positive coping in cancer patients has important
	and broad implications for research and practice. (PsycINFO Database

	SETTING: Two RT centers associated with a university hospital. SAMPLE:
	Patients who completed RT for prostate (n = 9) or breast cancer (n
	= 11). The mean age of the sample is 64 years. Ninety percent are
	Caucasian, 80% are married, 50% are of Latter-day Saint faith, and
	50% are retired. All had early stage disease, with a mean of 20 months

	scale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, satisfaction
	items of the Sarason Social Support Questionnaire, and Side Effect
	Severity Checklist. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Frequency of intrusive

	optimism, satisfaction with social support, severity of side effects,
	and themes extracted from semistructured interviews. FINDINGS: Most
	subjects had unexpected intrusive thoughts about cancer; more than
	one-third avoided reminders of cancer. The level of positive affect
	was high, as was optimism. The level of negative affect was low.
	Subjects' satisfaction level with social support was high. Fatigue
	was the most frequently reported continuing side effect. Relative
	optimism, acceptance, vigilance, and trust of healthcare providers
	were major themes. Avoidance, comparison, maintaining normalcy, and
	information seeking were common coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects
	perceived themselves to be doing well. Fatigue was the most common
	long-term side effect. Subjects continued to seek information. Symptom
	vigilance and interpretation were important, as were having a positive
	outlook and maintaining normalcy. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE:
	Nurses must acknowledge the potential for concerns about symptoms
	and continuing side effects and what they mean for the patient. Clinicians
	need to provide accurate information about common post-treatment
	experiences. Clinicians also must remember that subjects have vivid
	recollections of both positive and negative interactions with healthcare

	in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to either an easy
	goal or difficult goal condition. All completed the Revised Life

	task; rated their commitment to their assigned goal, their perception
	of the goal difficulty of their assigned goal, their satisfaction
	with their performance, and their expected and desired performance
	score; and answered some demographical questions. Three hypotheses
	were tested to explore the moderating effects of optimism on the
	relationships (a) goal difficulty and performance, (b) initial performance
	and subsequent performance on a second trial, and (c) performance
	and satisfaction with performance. The data did not support these
	hypothesized moderating relationships. Whereas optimism did not moderate
	the relationship between goal difficulty and performance, a post
	hoc analysis revealed that satisfaction with performance moderated
	the relationship between success and subsequent performance. This
	suggested that optimism is a stable trait-like personality characteristic,
	whereas satisfaction is a more state-like personality characteristic
	influenced by success. Thus, a more task-specific version of the
	LOT-R might better predict performance in task-specific settings.
	Other findings showed that optimism was positively related to subsequent
	performance by very optimistic people who had received negative feedback.
	Moreover, optimism positively related to satisfaction with performance,

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic cough is common, and medical treatment can be
	ineffective. Mindfulness is a psychological intervention that aims
	to teach moment-to-moment non-judgemental awareness of thoughts,
	feelings and sensations. METHOD: 30 healthy subjects and 30 patients
	with chronic cough were studied in two sequential trials. For both
	studies, cough reflex sensitivity to citric acid (C5) was measured
	on two occasions, with urge to cough rated following each inhalation;
	between challenges subjects were randomised to (1) no intervention,
	(2) mindfulness or (3) no intervention but modified cough challenge
	(subjects suppress coughing). For the healthy volunteers, measures
	were 1 h apart and mindfulness was practised for 15 min. For the
	patients with chronic cough measures were 1 week apart and mindfulness
	was practised daily for 30 min. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, median
	change (interquartile range (IQR)) in cough reflex sensitivity (logC5)
	for no intervention, mindfulness and suppression was +1.0 (0.0 to
	+1.3), +2.0 (+1.0 to +3.0) and +3.0 (+2.8 to +3.0) doubling concentrations
	(p = 0.003); there were significant reductions for both mindfulness
	(p = 0.043) and suppression (p = 0.002) over no intervention. In
	patients with cough, median change (IQR) in logC5 for no intervention,
	mindfulness training and voluntary suppression was 0.0 (-1.0 to +1.0),
	+1.0 (-0.3 to +1.0) and +1.0 (+1.0 to +2.0) doubling concentrations
	(p = 0.046); there was a significant reduction for suppression (p
	= 0.02) but not mindfulness (p = 0.35). Urge to cough did not change
	after mindfulness compared with control in either healthy subjects
	(p = 0.33) or those with chronic cough (p = 0.47). CONCLUSION: Compared
	with control, mindfulness decreased cough reflex sensitivity in healthy
	volunteers, but did not alter cough threshold in patients with chronic
	cough. Both groups were able to suppress cough responses to citric
