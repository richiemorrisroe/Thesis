* Refer back to Theory section in overall Discussion
[[file:Methodology.tex::\begin{itemize}][Here are the predictions]]
* Use predicted vs observed graphs and RMSEA to compare fitted regression models, rather than p-values (which are not available for lasso and ridge).
* Do SEM for scales for sample two in HOM chapter, also use backtesting
* Do backtesting/scales work in TCQ chapter
* Put more scoring stuff into Experimental chapter
