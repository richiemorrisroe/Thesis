* TODO Refer back to Theory section in overall Discussion
[[file:Methodology.tex::\begin{itemize}][Here are the predictions]] (apparently not :()
* TODO Fix references which give initials for first authors
* TODO Add reference to section 2 on treatment preference in TCQ chapter
* TODO Fix DiBlasi references
- these really should not have a hyphen
* TODO Need to add test of lagged physiological theory, or else remove this from the thesis
* TODO Maybe look at impact of high Opt & High Pess 
* TODO Fix MAAS IRT cross-validation
[[file:HealthforThesis.Rnw::<<hom1maasgrmtest,%20echo%3DFALSE,%20results%3Dtex>>%3D][Here is where the code fails]]
- Have removed the paragraph that talks about it, as its not critical
* DONE Use predicted vs observed graphs and RMSEA to compare fitted regression models, rather than p-values (which are not available for lasso and ridge).
  CLOSED: [2014-02-15 Sat 19:21]
Didn't do this, instead I removed the lasso and ridge regressions
* DONE Do SEM for scales for sample two in HOM chapter, also use backtesting
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 18:34]
This is SEM for the relationships between health, optimism, emwellbeing and mindfulness
* DONE Do backtesting/scales work in TCQ chapter
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 15:46]
* DONE Put more scoring stuff into Experimental chapter
  CLOSED: [2014-02-25 Tue 10:51]
Probably need to report the averaged factor score predictions.
Done for the TCQ measures
Done for the LOTR & MAAS - need to include these in the regressions
Ideally would weight them, but this is potentially too much work.
* DONE Add explanation of how IRT cross-validation was done in Methodology
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 16:56]
* DONE figure out how to reference stargazer tables
  CLOSED: [2014-02-15 Sat 19:21]
* DONE Add good descriptions of IIO and monotonicity assumptions to methodology section, under IRT part.
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 16:59]
* DONE Note problems that arose because of reflexivity (DevelopmentOfIAT)
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 15:51]
Just removed qualitative part
* DONE Decide whether or not its worth including the qualitative research in as much detail.
Decided to remove this section
  CLOSED: [2014-02-15 Sat 19:21]
* DONE Indent participant/interview comments appropriately, so it is easy to read.
  CLOSED: [2014-02-15 Sat 19:22]
* Add survivial analysis using proper time lengths from phys data
Is this really necessary?
* fit ARIMA models to pain data, estimate their accuracy.
Necessary?
* DONE Account for differences in GSR at baseline
  CLOSED: [2014-02-25 Tue 11:20]
* TODO fix GSR cross-correlations chart
I just took it out
* DONE examine why Kirsch two factor model shows such weird fit indices
  CLOSED: [2014-01-09 Thu 20:10]
* Find N and more details of Kirsch & Wiexel coffee study
#+BEGIN_SRC R
pwr.t.test(n=33, d=0.7) ##power for experiment approx 0.8
pwr.t.test(n=33, d=1.23) ##power for ischemic pain effects
#+END_SRC
* DONE Add stepwise optimism models to HOM chapter
  CLOSED: [2014-02-15 Sat 19:22]
* DONE Add reduced LOTR and MAAS models to experimental chapter
  CLOSED: [2014-02-25 Tue 12:11]
Need to average the respective factor scores solutions. Other approaches would take more time and be a little dodgy. 

* DONE justify physiological expectancies theory in experimental chapter - explain how you have justified it
  CLOSED: [2014-02-25 Tue 12:10]
* DONE Use BMQ factors from original research to assess convergent validity (this factor has been associated with adherence)
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 18:11]
Need to get surveymonkey data to match up all questions asked to what is in the completed general scale. 
BAM General Q's

BAM10
BAM13
BAM14
BAM17
* DONE put in details of BMQ sub-scales in Methodology section
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 15:33]
* include abstract for all data chapters
* DONE Fix up experimental and IAT Pilot chapter
  CLOSED: [2014-02-25 Tue 15:27]
Add TCQIAT data, make it clearer, relate it to the experiment (include power calculations)
* DONE talk about relationship between expectancies and optimism in experimental chapter and discussion
  CLOSED: [2014-02-25 Tue 12:06]
* DONE justify why the TCQ isn't a relative measure, in light of increasing correlation (hint, I've already written the answer)
  CLOSED: [2014-02-25 Tue 14:37]

* DONE Write conclusions and further research
  CLOSED: [2014-02-25 Tue 16:17]
* TODO Write overall abstract
* TODO Make sure figures and tables are in the best places in text
* DONE Match up backtesting with factor averaging in HOM chapter
  CLOSED: [2014-02-25 Tue 14:30]
This doesn't match, solutions are averaged, but backtesting is not done on the averaged solutions. 
The reason this was done was because the models are incomparable, given that there were only five items in the Split C results.
* TODO Make sure that there is no lagged effect of the physiological variables in experimental chapter (or remove the prediction). 
* TODO link physiological findings to embodied theory
* Note similarity between experiment and Kirsch and Weixel finding

** Introduction
[[The%20methods%20used%20for%20this%20part%20of%20the%20thesis%20were%20primarily%20psychometric.][And yet the introduction does not talk very much about psychometrics]]
- Fix this, make introduction more relevant and results more appropriate to it.

- Not particularly well, as I remember it. 
** Results
[[file:HealthforThesis.Rnw::print(tot.xtab,%20include.rownames%3DFALSE)%20#include%20packing%20rotating%20if%20fails][Maybe put sample one and two scale totals at this point?]]
Fix FA tables so either low results are supressed, or high loading ones are bold. 
[[https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2011-June/279822.html][This shows an example using xtable]]
[[file:HealthforThesis.Rnw::scales.hom1%20<-%20hom1%5B,66:73%5D][Higher order structure not particular clear when using scale totals for sample one, better for sample two]]
- Test if the generated factor structures provide a better fit.
- Maybe look at irtoys package to plot test functions in ggplot
