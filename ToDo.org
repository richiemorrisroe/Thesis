* TODO Refer back to Theory section in overall Discussion
[[file:Methodology.tex::\begin{itemize}][Here are the predictions]] (apparently not :()
* DONE Use predicted vs observed graphs and RMSEA to compare fitted regression models, rather than p-values (which are not available for lasso and ridge).
  CLOSED: [2014-02-15 Sat 19:21]
Didn't do this, instead I removed the lasso and ridge regressions
* DONE Do SEM for scales for sample two in HOM chapter, also use backtesting
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 18:34]
This is SEM for the relationships between health, optimism, emwellbeing and mindfulness
* DONE Do backtesting/scales work in TCQ chapter
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 15:46]
* Put more scoring stuff into Experimental chapter
Probably need to report the averaged factor score predictions.
Ideally would weight them, but this is potentially too much work.
* DONE Add explanation of how IRT cross-validation was done in Methodology
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 16:56]
* DONE figure out how to reference stargazer tables
  CLOSED: [2014-02-15 Sat 19:21]
* DONE Add good descriptions of IIO and monotonicity assumptions to methodology section, under IRT part.
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 16:59]
* DONE Note problems that arose because of reflexivity (DevelopmentOfIAT)
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 15:51]
Just removed qualitative part
* DONE Decide whether or not its worth including the qualitative research in as much detail.
Decided to remove this section
  CLOSED: [2014-02-15 Sat 19:21]
* DONE Indent participant/interview comments appropriately, so it is easy to read.
  CLOSED: [2014-02-15 Sat 19:22]
* Add survivial analysis using proper time lengths from phys data
Is this really necessary?
* fit ARIMA models to pain data, estimate their accuracy.
Necessary?
* TODO Account for differences in GSR at baseline
* TODO fix GSR cross-correlations chart
* DONE examine why Kirsch two factor model shows such weird fit indices
  CLOSED: [2014-01-09 Thu 20:10]
* Find N and more details of Kirsch & Wiexel coffee study
#+BEGIN_SRC R
pwr.t.test(n=33, d=0.7) ##power for experiment approx 0.8
pwr.t.test(n=33, d=1.23) ##power for ischemic pain effects
#+END_SRC
* DONE Add stepwise optimism models to HOM chapter
  CLOSED: [2014-02-15 Sat 19:22]
* TODO Add reduced LOTR and MAAS models to experimental chapter
Need to average the respective factor scores solutions. Other approaches would take more time and be a little dodgy. 
* TODO link physiological findings to embodied theory
* DONE Use BMQ factors from original research to assess convergent validity (this factor has been associated with adherence)
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 18:11]
Need to get surveymonkey data to match up all questions asked to what is in the completed general scale.

* DONE put in details of BMQ sub-scales in Methodology section
  CLOSED: [2014-02-24 Mon 15:33]
* include abstract for all data chapters
* TODO Fix up experimental and IAT Pilot chapter
Add TCQIAT data, make it clearer, relate it to the experiment (include power calculations)
* TODO talk about relationship between expectancies and optimism in experimental chapter and discussion
* TODO justify why the TCQ isn't a relative measure, in light of increasing correlation (hint, I've already written the answer)
* TODO justify physiological expectancies theory in experimental chapter - explain how you have justified it
* TODO Write conclusions and further research
* TODO Write overall abstract
* TODO Make sure figures and tables are in the best places in text
