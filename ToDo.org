* Refer back to Theory section in overall Discussion
[[file:Methodology.tex::\begin{itemize}][Here are the predictions]]
* Use predicted vs observed graphs and RMSEA to compare fitted regression models, rather than p-values (which are not available for lasso and ridge).
* Do SEM for scales for sample two in HOM chapter, also use backtesting
* Do backtesting/scales work in TCQ chapter
* Put more scoring stuff into Experimental chapter
* Add explanation of how IRT cross-validation was done
* figure out how to reference stargazer tables
* Add good descriptions of IIO and monotonicity assumptions to methodology section, under IRT part.
* Note problems that arose because of reflexivity (DevelopmentOfIAT)
* Decide whether or not its worth including the qualitative research in as much detail.
* Indent participant/interview comments appropriately, so it is easy to read.
* Add survivial analysis using proper time lengths from phys data
* fit ARIMA models to pain data, estimate their accuracy.
* Account for differences in GSR at baseline
* TODO fix GSR cross-correlations chart
* DONE examine why Kirsch two factor model shows such weird fit indices

* Find N and more details of Kirsch & Wiexel coffee study
#+BEGIN_SRC R
pwr.t.test(n=33, d=0.7) ##power for experiment approx 0.8
pwr.t.test(n=33, d=1.23) ##power for ischemic pain effects
#+END_SRC
* Add stepwise optimism models to HOM chapter
* Add reduced LOTR and MAAS models to experimental chapter
* link physiological findings to embodied theory
* Use BMQ factors from original research to assess convergent validity (this factor has been associated with adherence)
* put in details of BMQ sub-scales in Methodology section
* include abstract for all data chapters
