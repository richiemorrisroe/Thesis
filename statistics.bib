	including a sketch of missing data theory and descriptions of normalmodel
	
	multiple imputation (MI) and maximum likelihood methods.
	
	Practical missing data analysis issues are discussed, most notably
	the
	
	inclusion of auxiliary variables for improving power and reducing
	bias.
	
	Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal,
	
	categorical, and clustered data with normal-model MI; including
	
	interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers
	of
	
	variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness
	emphasizes
	
	the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty
	
	about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies
	
	suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables,
	
	collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing,
	and
	
	collecting data on intent to drop out. Suggestions are given for moving
	
	forward with research on missing data and attrition.},
