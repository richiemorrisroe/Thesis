* Introduction
[[The%20methods%20used%20for%20this%20part%20of%20the%20thesis%20were%20primarily%20psychometric.][And yet the introduction does not talk very much about psychometrics]]
- Fix this, make introduction more relevant and results more appropriate to it.
* Results
[[file:HealthforThesis.Rnw::print(tot.xtab,%20include.rownames%3DFALSE)%20#include%20packing%20rotating%20if%20fails][Maybe put sample one and two scale totals at this point?]]
Fix FA tables so either low results are supressed, or high loading ones are bold. 
[[https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2011-June/279822.html][This shows an example using xtable]]
[[file:HealthforThesis.Rnw::scales.hom1%20<-%20hom1%5B,66:73%5D][Higher order structure not particular clear when using scale totals for sample one, better for sample two]]
- Test if the generated factor structures provide a better fit.
- Maybe look at irtoys package to plot test functions in ggplot
