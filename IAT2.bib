	likely reflects their knowledge of these negative stereotypes, rather

  abstract = {Associations between certain odors and for instance health effects
	may lead to positive or negative attitudes toward these odors. However,
	in experiments we conducted using the Implicit Association Test (IAT),
	we encountered attitudes even to odor "words." The IAT is based on
	the principle that reaction times measuring the association between
	words from a target dimension (in this case, odor vs. a neutral reference
	category) and an attribute dimension (i.e., positive or negative
	words) reflect the attitude to the target, where attitude-congruent
	associations between target and attribute are reflected by shorter
	reaction times. In a first experiment, we found distinctly positive
	attitudes to the concept odor in a student sample, which was replicated
	in a second experiment. In the main experiment, subjects in the aromatherapy
	group, who prefer using scented consumer products for relaxation
	purposes, showed a significantly more positive attitude toward odor
	words in the IAT than a control group, who did not have such a preference.
	The fact that results from the implicit test were not always associated
	with explicitly stated attitudes toward the odor words attests to
	the fact that the IAT measures the attitude of interest in a different
	way. As such, the IAT has added value in circumstances where explicit
	tests can be biased. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all

	A popular assumption is that narcissists' positive explicit (conscious)
	self-views mask implicit (nonconscious) self-loathing. This belief
	is typically traced to psychodynamic theory, especially that of Kohut
	(1966; Morrison, 1983). Empirically, this view predicts that narcissists
	will reveal negative self-views when these are measured with unobtrusive
	instruments--such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald,
	McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998)--that record people's automatic, uncontrolled
	responses. We tested our logic that narcissism correlates positively
	with implicit agency and negatively or not at all with implicit communion
	in two studies. Using the IAT words from Jordan et al. (2003), we
	tested the link between narcissism and implicit self-esteem in a
	sample of undergraduates. Next, we created separate IATs to measure
	agentic and communal implicit self-views and tested their associations
	with narcissism. In sum, it may be imprecise to conceptualize narcissism
	as a positive explicit self-concept blanketing a negative implicit
	self-concept. Rather, narcissists exhibit a somewhat imbalanced self
	at both explicit and implicit levels, with favorable agentic self-views
	that are not necessarily matched by favorable communal self-views.

	of agency and communion. Study 3 (N = 23) found individual differences
	in linking the self-concept to characteristics of boldness and friendliness.
	Reliability of the Palm IAT is similar to reliability of the original

	measures of self-esteem are unreliable. (from the book) The authors
	propose that an indirect measure of self-esteem has the potential
	of shedding light on the relationship between personal self-esteem
	and ingroup favoritism. A potential indirect measure is provided
	by the Implicit Association Test (IAT: A. G. Greenwald et al, 1998)

	(1) reviews the construct validity of self-report measures of self-esteem;

	explicit attitudes are judgments or evaluations that are well established

	(IAT) developed by Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz (1998) to index

	attitudes that participants may be reluctant to express. Independent

  __markedentry = {[Richard Morrisroe]},
  abstract = {The Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, Schwartz, 1998)
	has been presented to the research community and to the public as
	a measure of attitudes. More than this, it has been said to have
	the ability to measure prejudices, stereotypes, and self-conceptions
	that people do not realize that they have. The task operates on the
	premise that, when two concepts are conceptually close (i.e., a "match"
	of concepts), it is easier to pair them together in a single judgment
	than when the two concepts are conceptually distinct (i.e., a "mismatch"
	of concepts). Performance on this categorization task is operationalized
	as the difference in reaction time for match judgments and mismatch
	judgments. These difference scores are then interpreted as measures
	of various social constructs, particularly attitudes, stereotypes,
	and self-concepts. In this dissertation, I provide a review showing
	that difference scores influence statistical measures of associations
	in ways that are not consistent with the interpretation of past IAT
	results. More damaging, I will show that an accurate interpretation
	of these past associations fails to support past conclusions made
	using the measure. Following this review, I report two experiments
	showing that these statistical properties obscure fairly basic relationships
	between IAT measures and external criterion scores. They also created
	the appearance of relationships that were mistakenly interpreted
	as evidence that the IAT is a valid measure of attitudes, stereotypes
	and self-concepts. In response to the problems of difference scores,
	I applied a more defensible analytic method to the IAT, based on
	linear regression. This was done to determine if responses on match
	judgments interacted with responses on mismatch judgments in theoretically
	meaningful ways to predict criterion scores. No evidence of such
	interactions was found. This review and these results shed serious
	doubt on the validity of the IAT as a measure of attitudes, stereotypes,
	and identities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights

	self to a general other. The results indicated that a) There were
	significant differences between explicit closeness across the three

	that have been developed within cognitive psychology. By applying
	the same taxonomy to the various indirect measures of attitudes,
	the essential similarities and differences between these measures

	in non-conscious influences on behavior in social psychology and
	this work has managed to find its way into the literature on the
	attitude-behavior relationship. One construct that has received a
	great deal of attention is that of implicit attitudes, with the most
	recognizable research program being that of Greenwald and associates
	on the Implicit Association Test (e.g., Greenwald, et al., 2002).
	Another important area of research has been on automaticity, which
	has focused on the effects of priming and attitude accessibility
	on the attitude-behavior relationship (e.g., Bargh, 1996; Fazio,
	1990). This research has emerged independent of the TRA and the TPB
	and the field would benefit from a theoretical integration of the
	different streams of research. In a recent chapter, Ajzen and Fishbein
	(2000) thoughtfully describe how research on automatic processes
	complements and fits within the Theory of Reasoned Action and the
	Theory of Planned Behavior. They also briefly discuss the role of
	implicit attitudes relative to the attitudinal constructs in their
	theories in Ajzen & Fishbein (2005). Given how popular research on
	implicit attitudes has become, it is important to examine this literature
	critically and to place it in the context of the more traditional
	and influential attitude theories of Fishbein and Ajzen. This chapter
	does so. We begin by presenting a brief summary of features of the
	Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior relevant
	to the analysis of the attitude-behavior relationship. We then consider
	the conceptual definition of an implicit attitude and how this differs
	from traditional definitions of attitude. We next describe the most
	popular methodology used to measure implicit attitudes, the Implicit
	Association Test (IAT). We examine the conceptual and measurement
	underpinnings of the IAT and map these onto basic principles derived
	from the TRA and the TPB about the attitude-behavior relationship.
	We suggest possible mechanisms through which implicit constructs
	may impact behavior using the TRA and the TPB as an organizing framework.
	Finally, we discuss directions for future research on the attitude-behavior
	relationship using implicit constructs. (PsycINFO Database Record

	In Study 1 the sample consisted of 63 school students (11th grade)

	Study 1 measured participants' implicit associations between physics
	(relative to English) and the image dimensions of difficulty, masculinity
	and heteronomy, implicit attitudes towards and identification with
	physics using latency data (Implicit Association Test; IAT) and explicit
	attitudes using a questionnaire. Study 2 was an experimental treatment
	that required reading a text (treatment group) that emphasized the
	importance of discourse and creativity for science versus a school
	textbook for physics (control group). Dependent variables: implicit
	attitudes (IAT). Results: Students in Study 1 associated physics
	(relative to English) more easily with words referring to difficulty
	(than to ease), to males (than to females), to heteronomy (than to
	self-realization), to unpleasantness (relative to pleasant words)

	as well as methodological properties of the Implicit Life Satisfaction
	measure (ILS). The ILS demonstrated good internal consistency and
	moderate temporal stability. Studies revealed that: (i) the type
	of stimuli used for target and attribute categories influences the
	magnitude of the ILS effect; (ii) participants could voluntarily
	suppress their satisfaction with life on the ILS, but not enhance
	it; and (iii) handedness of categories did not affect the participants'
	performance on the ILS. Overall, the ILS measures are: (i) independent
	of traditional life satisfaction self report measures; and (ii) positive
	for most people. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights

	employed a new methodology that has been widely used in investigations
	of implicit attitudes, the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald,
	McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), to assess covert self-esteem and to test
	the above prediction. Overt self-esteem was assessed using the Rosenberg
	Self-Esteem Scale and an adjective self-relevance ratings measure.
	These measures were administered to 10 patients with acute persecutory
	delusions, 10 patients with remitted persecutory delusions, and 19
	healthy control participants. Results: Patients with persecutory
	delusions were found to have lower covert self-esteem (as assessed
	using the IAT) than healthy controls and patients with remitted persecutory
	delusions. On two measures of overt self-esteem, however, the persecutory
	deluded group did not differ significantly from the other groups
	once the effects of comorbid depression had been taken into account.
	Conclusions: These results are thus consistent with a model of persecutory
	delusions as serving the defensive function of maintaining self-esteem.

	The Rosenberg scale served as an index of overt self-esteem. A total
	of 23 schizophrenic patients, 13 of whom showed current symptoms
	of persecutory delusions, participated in the study; 41 healthy and
	14 depressed participants served as controls. Results: Schizophrenic

	with current ideas of persecutory delusions displayed greater explicit

	lends partial support for the notion that persecutory delusions serve
	as a defence against low implicit self-esteem, although the explicit
	self-esteem of these patients is still lower than in normal participants.
	Apart from abnormalities of attributional style, which have been
	assumed to convert low into high self-esteem, the assumption that
	a 'feeling of personal significance' heightens self-esteem in paranoid

	The affective priming technique and the Implicit Association Test
	(IAT), designed to uncover implicit biases, are well described by
	Arkes and Tetlock. Both techniques assume that the faster the reaction
	time between stimuli, the greater the association between them in
	semantic memory. The affective priming method involves the presentation
	of a series of priming and target stimuli and measuring the reaction
	time for making a judgment about each target stimuli as a function
	of the prime. Arkes and Tetlock provide a tour-de-force critique
	of the implicit prejudice literature by challenging the assumption
	that the IAT and affective priming techniques tap personally held
	prejudicial attitudes rather than knowledge of well-learned cultural
	stereotypes. The distinction between stereotype and prejudice is
	a critical one. Further, as Arkes and Tetlock point out, attitudes
	and behavior termed prejudice may reflect reliance on culturally
	salient stereotypes that to some extent reflect social reality. Arkes
	and Tetlocks's critique is courageous, given the "politically sensitive"
	nature of research and public discourse on the emotionally charged
	issue of racial prejudice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA,

	efforts to assess self-esteem indirectly (implicit self-esteem: ISE).
	It has been theorized that ISE and ESE reflect the operation of largely
	distinct mental systems. However, although low correlations between
	measures of ISE and ESE empirically support their discriminant validity,
	similarly low correlations between different measures of ISE do not
	support their convergent validity. We explored whether such patterns
	would reemerge if more recently developed, specific, and reliable
	ISE measures were used. They did, although some convergent validity
	among ISE measures emerged once confounds resulting from conceptual
	mismatch, individual differences, and random variability were minimized.
	Nonetheless, low correlations among ISE measures are not primarily
	caused by the usual psychometric suspects, and may be the result
	of other factors including subtle differences between structural
	features of such measures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA,

	Whether such IATs can be influenced by a mere acceptance effect is
	unknown, though. By manipulating whether "Black" or "White" was the
	focal category on a names-based racial IAT, the present studies addressed
	this very issue. The results were consistent with the operation of

	the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz,
	1998), which provides valid measurements for testing the principles
	of the unified theory. Then, we expand the concepts of the unified
	theory of implicit social cognition to the consumer branding literature
	to demonstrate how numerous brand-related concepts can be defined
	and operationalized within a single framework. We present testable
	propositions based on a unified implicit brand theory, and explain
	how the IAT can be used to test them. Finally, we suggest novel insights
	that can be drawn from a unified implicit brand theory, and how these
	insights might enable us to reexamine fundamental approaches to consumer
	behavior, including theories of persuasion and behavioral modification.
	The unified theory of implicit social cognition (Greenwald et al.,
	2002) provides a theoretical framework that integrates all of social

	Furthermore, the empirical model operationalized by the balanced

	the interrelationships and dynamics of these constructs within a

	range of brand-related constructs, the unified theory, along with
	the balanced design and IAT, provides a research approach to explore
	consumer-brand cognitions at the implicit level. Theories of behavioral

	of cognitive mediation may now be further understood in light of
	implicit cognitive processes that can be measured using the IAT.

  abstract = {Three studies demonstrated that auditory implicit association tests
	(auditory IATs) using speech and environmental-sound stimuli could
	be used to measure implicit attitudes and stereotypes. Study 1 showed
	a preference for songbirds over insects in auditory IATs that used
	(a) speech stimuli (spoken names of songbirds and insects), and (b)
	stimuli consisting of sounds made by songbirds and insects, in conjunction
	with text stimuli consisting of positive and negative words. Study
	2 showed that two IATs using only auditory stimuli could measure
	implicit gender stereotypes. The first used male and female voices
	in conjunction with high-power and low-power words spoken by a non-gendered
	computerized voice to measure sex differences in gender stereotypes.
	The second used the same high- and low-power words in conjunction
	with male and female names spoken by the non-gendered voice. Study
	3 showed implicit attitudes favoring European-Americans over African-Americans
	using an auditory IAT in which participants classified speech segments
	based on the accent of the speaker, thus measuring personally and/or
	socially undesirable implicit racial attitudes that were not detected
	through explicit self-report measures. The studies demonstrate that
	the auditory IAT is an extension of the IAT that can measure implicit
	associations in a variety of situations in which IATs consisting
	entirely of visual or text stimuli are not applicable. Exploration
	of the relationships between the various IATs suggested that their
	results reflect automatic cognitive associations that are influenced
	by factors within the IAT procedure, such as the stimuli chosen to
	represent the target categories, and external contextual factors
	such as associations made salient by preceding experiences. For example,
	Study 3 found that a picture IAT using neutral faces measured significantly
	stronger implicit attitudes favoring European-Americans over African-Americans
	than were measured by a sound IAT using friendly greetings. However,
	the difference was only observed when the picture IAT was completed
	first. When the sound IAT was first, the associations with friendly
	targets apparently remained salient, and implicit attitudes did not
	differ. Such findings suggest possibilities for better understanding
	automatic associations and the way they are measured by the IAT.

	and nonstrategic). A further threat to validity is discussed in a

	explained by a rather trivial small-scale theory, that is, by assuming
	simple intentional receding strategies of participants. With this
	example, it is of course not our point to trivialize all results
	found with the IAT, but to opt for further small-scale-oriented research
	that searches for procedural recommendations that might differentiate
	between automatic and strategic components of an IAT effect (again:
	"automatic," in the sense given above). Finally, we want to discuss
	why we stress the importance of small-scale theorizing, knowing that
	others obviously follow a different route: They accept (at least
	tentatively) the association account and persistently examine matters
	of convergent and discriminant validity by correlating IAT results
	with other measures, such as self-reports or behaviors. In contrast,
	we will argue that a social cognition perspective is intimately tied

	has no other measures than those measures. Therefore, we should clearly
	know what they measure. And this can be done only by establishing
	valid small-scale theories (i.e., theories that link an experimental
	technique with global theories about mental representations and the
	processes that operate on these representations). (PsycINFO Database

	activation from the impact that an attitude object has on the speed
	with which a person can make certain judgments when such a judgment
	is preceded (i.e., "primed") by the attitude object. Priming measures
	were the first to start the trend toward the new implicit assessment
	techniques. They give researchers relatively stringent control over
	what psychological processes contribute to the attitudinal response
	that is being assessed. They are also less invasive and easier to
	administer than comparable techniques based on physiological measures,
	although they require significantly more control over the assessment
	situation than the Implicit Association Test (IAT), another common
	implicit technique based on response latency measures (see the corresponding
	chapters in this volume). The goal of this chapter is to provide
	an overview of existing priming measures for scholars interested
	in using such procedures for their own research. The chapter offers
	an introduction to the basic technique of priming as well as a review
	of relevant findings in order to allow researchers a critical evaluation
	of what can and cannot be accomplished with this kind of attitude
	measure. Specifically, I describe the procedures that have been employed,

	research. Topics include what makes a measure "implicit"; the extent
	to which implicit measures, like explicit measures, are context dependent;
