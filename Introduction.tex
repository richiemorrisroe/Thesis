\chapter{Introduction}


The central aim of this thesis was to examine of measurement of psychological constructs in the context of the placebo effect. This thesis used self-report, interview, implicit and physiological variables in an examination of the placebo effect. 

% This thesis contributes a more comprehensive investigation of a psychological phenomenon from multiple methods of data collection, and could serve as a model for similiar approaches to other constructs. 

Another contribution of this thesis is that it uses large samples to develop psychometric models of responses to self-report instruments, and then applies these models to help estimate effects in an experimental sample more accurately. 

In addition, this thesis developed two new implicit measures -- an Optimism Implicit Association Test (IAT) and a Treatment Credibility Implicit Association Test. Self report measures of both of these constructs were collected also, and this allowed for the relative usefulness of these different forms of measurement to be determined in the prediction of the placebo response. 

Finally, this thesis  made use of more sensitive and appropriate statistical models and methods, and applied these methods to the more precise estimation of placebo effects in an experimental sample of healthy volunteers drawn from the sample population. 


The aims of this research were as follows:


\begin{enumerate}

\item To use modern psychometric methods to allow for better prediction of the factors involved with the placebo response. 

\item To compare the predictive power of implicitly and explicitly measured constructs as predictors the placebo response. 

\item To develop a multifaceted method of assessing explicit expectancies which can be linked to the placebo response

\item To create implicit measure to assess expectancies related to treatment and to the placebo response

\item To conduct one large experimental study to test the utility of the measurement and psychometric approaches taken. 

\item To use physiological data as another signal for the assessment of placebo response. 
\end{enumerate}

This thesis follows the following structure:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Chapter \ref{cha:literature-review} reviews the literature surrounding the placebo response, implicit measurement and self report. 
\item Chapter \ref{cha:methodology} describes the approaches taken towards measurement in this thesis, as well as the research designs.
\item Chapter \ref{cha:notes-towards-theory} describes a perspective on the placebo response informed by Chapters \ref{cha:literature-review} and \ref{cha:methodology}.
\item Chapter \ref{cha:health-for-thesis} describes the analysis of selef report variables which have been associated with placebo effect (optimism) as well as with response to implicit measures (mindfulness). 
\item Chapter \ref{cha:tcqthesis} describes the development and validation of the Treatment Credibility Questionnaire, the self report method used to assess expectancies.
\item Chapter \ref{cha:development-of-iats} describes the approach taken to the development of the stimuli for the implicit association tests, using multiple methods. 
\item Chapter \ref{cha:primary-research} describes the experimental portion of the research, and models these results incorporating the models developed for the self report measures in Chapters \ref{cha:health-for-thesis} and \ref{cha:tcqthesis}
\item Finally, Chapter \ref{cha:general-discussion} summarises what has been learned from this thesis, and gives directions towards future research.

% The central aim of this thesis was to apply new psychometric methods to the prediction of the placebo response to pain in healthy volunteers. The new psychometric method applied to the prediction of placebo was the Implicit Association Test, or IAT, which is a reaction time based categorisation method developed in the last fifteen years. 

% It is the contention of this research that the alleged unpredictability of the placebo effect is a function of our measurement tool and our statistical methods, and that new and improved measurement tools can furnish us with a placebo effect which can be reliably assessed and predicted. 

% Although some form of placebo effect has been an integral part of medicine for at least the last 2000 years, it is only over the past sixty years that it has been conceptualised and operationalised in such a form as to make my research possible. 

% Indeed, the major tool proposed by this research for the prediction of the placebo response is itself a more recent development than the construction of a defined placebo response. Implicit measures are further defined in the later sections of this work, but for now we can model them as associations which lie outside our awareness much of the time which colour many aspects of our social lives. In another age and time, these measures would have been called unconscious, but such a conceptualisation runs into the tricky problems of unfalsifiability and so, nowadays, most researchers prefer to substitute the term implicit. 


% Of course, this short introduction merely scratches the surface of what has been a hugely rewarding, frustrating and interesting research experience. Mere words cannot convey all that has occurred, but given the format required of us by the scientific community at this time, they shall have to do. The plan for this section of the thesis is as follows. 
% The structure of the thesis shall be as follows:

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item The literature on the placebo effect and implicit measures shall be reviewed, as will the literature of constructs which appear to have been predictive of the placebo effect in the past. 

% \item The methodology for the thesis shall then be described.

% \item The results of a preliminary study relating health, optimism and mindfulness (all of which have been related to placebo or implicit measures) shall be described. 

% \item The development and assessment of a measure designed to tap response expectancies to pain treatments shall be described. 


% \item The development of the implicit measures shall be described, including a process of interviewing health professionals and a method of developing IAT stimuli for arbitrary constructs. 


% \item Next, the experimental data will be analysed, and the usefulness of the models and measures used assessed. As part of this, the inter-relationships between the implicit, explicit, physiological and behavioural measures will be examined.


% \item Finally, the thesis will conclude with a discussion of what has been discovered, and plans for future research.
