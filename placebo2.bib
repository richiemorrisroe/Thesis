	or no effect. With qualifications, they view the different
                  effects

                  the

                  is
	concealed, prior drug treatment effects persist for some
                  period of

                  associated
	with open drug administration were present after drug
                  withdrawal.
	Labeling aside, Benedetti et al's results indicate that

	a caring doctor-patient relationship can be justified on

	Can it also be justified as a direct physiologic intervention?
                  Two
	lines of evidence point in this direction. People in an
                  empathic
	relationship exhibit a correlation of indicators of autonomic
                  activity.
	This occurs between speakers and responsive listeners, members
                  of
	a coherent group, and bonded pairs of higher social
                  animals. Furthermore,
	the experience of feeling cared about in a relationship
                  reduces the
	secretion of stress hormones and shifts the neuroendocrine
                  system
	toward homeostasis. Because the social engagement of emotions
                  is
	simultaneously the social engagement of the physiologic
                  substrate
	of those emotions, the process has been labeled
                  sociophysiology.
	This process can influence the health of both parties in the
                  doctor-patient
	relationship, and may be relevant to third parties.},

                  fetal

                  ethical
	concerns associated with sham surgery controls. Macklin, and
                  Dekkers

	presents a broad argument against sham surgery controls while

                  criticisms.
	Appropriate clinical trial design, sometimes including sham
                  surgery,
	is needed to ensure that false positive trial results do not
                  occur
	and endanger public safety. Results of a completed trial of
                  fetal
	tissue grafting for Parkinson's disease are used to illustrate
                  the
	potential benefits of, and problems associated with, sham
                  surgery
	controls. Sham surgery controls, however, should be employed
                  only
	when absolutely necessary. I suggest criteria for appropriate

	229 adults participated. Placebo analgesic responses were
                  evoked
	by cognitive expectation cues, drug conditioning, or a
                  combination.
	Drug conditioning used the opioid agonist morphine
                  hydrochloride
	or the nonopioid ketorolac tromethamine. Expectation cues
                  produced
	placebo responses that were blocked by the opioid antagonist
                  naloxone.
	Expectation cues together with morphine conditioning produced
                  placebo
	responses that were antagonized by naloxone. Morphine
                  conditioning
	alone induced a naloxone-reversible placebo effect. By
                  contrast,
	ketorolac conditioning together with expectation cues elicited
                  a
	placebo effect that was partially blocked by
                  naloxone. Ketorolac
	conditioning alone produced placebo responses that were
                  naloxone-insensitive.
	Therefore, the authors evoked different types of placebo
                  responses
	that were either naloxone-reversible or partially
                  naloxone-reversible
	or, otherwise, naloxone-insensitive, depending on the
                  procedure used
	to evoke the response. Findings show cognitive factors and
                  conditioning
	are differently balanced in placebo analgesia, and this
                  balance is
	crucial for the activation of opioid or nonopioid
                  systems. (PsycINFO

                  are advertised
	as being superior to placebo even though most are also tested
                  against
	existing treatments. The propriety of doing PCTs in depression
                  was
	the topic of a recent article (A. Khan et al, 2000) and 1 of
                  the
	conclusions was that the size of response in the placebo group
                  was
	sufficient to justify continuing with PCTs, even though the
                  existence
	of proven treatments would normally render PCTs
                  unethical. Sometimes
	antidepressant drugs fail to show superiority over placebo,
                  simply
	because the treatments are not very powerful compared with the
                  change
	in the placebo control group. Two factors contribute to this
                  change
	in the placebo group: the placebo effect proper, which arises
                  from
	the sensitivity of patients to the encouragement that comes
                  from
	being treated, plus improvement due to the natural history of
                  remission

	their patients. Perhaps we should actively strive to
                  potentiate the
	placebo effect when treating people with depression. (PsycINFO

                  effect is an
	important methodological tool. Placebo is given to
                  participants in
	clinical trials, with the intention of mimicking an
                  experimental
	intervention. The "nocebo" effect, on the other hand, is the
                  phenomenon
	whereby a patient who believes that a treatment will cause
                  harm actually
	does experience adverse effects. The placebo effect strongly
                  influences
	the way the results of clinical trials are
                  interpreted. Placebo responses
	vary with the choice of study design, the choice of primary
                  outcome
	measure, the characteristics of the patients and the cultural
                  setting
	in which the trial is conducted. In migraine trials, the
                  placebo
	response is high, in terms of both efficacy and side
                  effects. Although
	medical ethics committees are becoming increasingly resistant
                  to
	the use of placebo in acute migraine trials, placebo
                  nevertheless

  abstract = {Rationale: A neutral stimulus repeatedly paired with
                  administration
	of a drug may elicit a conditioned response. This process,
                  termed
	pharmacological classical conditioning, may be important in
                  the understanding
	of placebo effects. Objective: The unconditioned response to
                  caffeine
	is increased physiological and psychological arousal. The
                  present
	study investigated whether stimuli associated with the use of
                  caffeine,
	i.e. the smell and taste of coffee, elicited a conditioned
                  increase
	in arousal. It was also investigated whether conditioned
                  arousal
	modulated the unconditioned arousal induced by
                  caffeine. Methods:
	Twenty subjects who drank at least two cups of coffee per day
                  were
	exposed to four conditions in a within-subjects design, where
                  the
	subjects received coffee or orange juice crossed with placebo
                  or
	2 mg/kg caffeine. Dependent variables were skin conductance
                  responses
	and startle reflexes to 85 dB noise bursts, skin conductance
                  levels,
	blood pressure, heart rate, and subjective measures of
                  arousal. Results:
	Both caffeine (caffeinated juice) and caffeine-associated
                  stimuli
	(decaffeinated coffee) increased subjective and physiological
                  arousal.
	When caffeine and caffeine-associated stimuli were presented
                  together
	(caffeinated coffee), a non-significant tendency towards an
                  additive
	effect of the conditioned arousal on the unconditioned arousal
                  to
	caffeine was seen in some dependent variables. Conclusions:
                  Presentation
	of caffeine-associated stimuli to caffeine-users elicited
                  conditioned
	responses similar to the unconditioned drug response. Thus,
                  presentation
	of caffeine-associated stimuli could be used as an
                  experimental model
	of placebo effects.},

                  test the
	effect of experimenter gender on the placebo analgesic
                  response.
	METHODS: Sixty-three (n = 32 females) students participated in
                  a
	within-subjects design where subjects were tested on two
                  separate
	days, one day for the experimental condition (placebo) and one
                  day
	for the natural history condition. In the experimental
                  condition,
	the participants received capsules containing lactose with
                  information
	that the capsules were a high dose of a potent painkiller. In
                  the
	natural history condition, the procedures were identical
                  except that
	the placebo capsules were not administrated. The experimenters
                  were
	blinded to the fact that all participants received
                  placebo. Pain
	was induced by a thermode holding +46 degrees C with duration
                  of
	240 seconds to the forearm. Electrocardiogram was measured to
                  obtain
	data for analysis of heart rate variability. Subjective
                  measurements
	consisted of pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, stress,
                  arousal,
	and mood. RESULTS: The results showed a placebo effect on pain
                  intensity
	and a concomitant reduction in subjective stress and cardiac
                  activity.
	Stepwise regressions revealed that reduced subjective stress
                  was
	the only predictor for the placebo analgesic
                  response. Contrary to
	our hypothesis, male subjects displayed increased placebo
                  analgesia
	when a male acted as experimenter. CONCLUSIONS: The results
                  indicate
	that reduced negative emotional activation could be a
                  mechanism in
	placebo analgesia and that experimenter gender is probably not
                  systematically

	and at the end of each period, using mercury manometer and 24
                  hour
	non invasive ambulatory BP monitor. Placebo showed a
                  significant
	reduction in systolic and diastolic clinic BP (- 3.4 Â±

                  were

	(-5.2 Â± 6.2 mmHg and -4.8 Â± 7.8 mmHg; P <

	specific to placebo administration since the measurements
                  without
	treatment did not show any significant difference. The
                  comparison

	ambulatory systolic BP recorded during the 24 hour, daytime

	a specific effect of placebo. Although, this study clearly

                  the natural
	healing properties of the human body. In many modern medical
                  researches
	over a third of the population have shown a positive effect
                  for placebos
	in double blind trials. Yet, no study has been attempted to
                  explain
	the unexplained curing effects of placebos, a subject that is
                  conveniently
	swept under the carpet by modern science. The amazing
                  capabilities
	of the human mind and body to rid itself of disease were
                  recognised
	and applied by the traditional medical systems. The human body
                  is
	too complicated to rationalize, and is endowed with nature's
                  finest
	defence system in order to preserve itself. There are no
                  placebos,

                  response of patients
	with panic disorder presenting with palpitations, we
                  hypothesized
	that therapeutic response would correlate with heart rate
                  variability
	(HRV) and sleep measures. METHODS: After a 1-week placebo
                  washout,
	27 patients free of structural heart disease and not on
                  cardioactive
	drugs were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to 4 weeks
                  of treatment
	with clonazepam (a known antipanic agent) or placebo. We
                  performed
	standard sleep measures and recorded HRV from 24-hour Holter
                  acquisitions
	at baseline and end of study. We defined response to therapy
                  as a
	50% improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS)
                  score,
	confirmed by questionnaires and reaction to sodium lactate
                  infusion.
	RESULTS: There were 12 responders and 15
                  nonresponders. Normalization
	of sleep pattern (including less stage 1 and rapid eye
                  movement [REM]
	sleep) was observed in both drug and placebo responders (P =
                  0.011
	and P = 0.05, respectively) and in placebo responders alone,
                  compared
	with nonresponders (P = 0.006 and P = 0.013,
                  respectively). Placebo
	responders were more likely to show less depression, but even
                  after
	we controlled for depression, main sleep effects
                  remained. None of
	the HRV measures correlated with response, but compared with
                  placebo,
	clonazepam led to a decrease in all the time and frequency
                  domain
	measures of HRV (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Central
                  mechanisms are
	related to the therapeutic response of patients with panic
                  disorder
	presenting with palpitations, but this does not directly
                  correlate

	How can a treatment which doubles the rate of cognitive
                  decline,
	triples the rate of stroke, doubles mortality, substantially
                  increases
	falls and fractures and reduces quality of life be beneficial,
                  especially,
	as in real life, once neuroleptics are started they are rarely
                  discontinued
	with cumulative adverse effects? As there is clearly no
                  rational
	reason for prescribing, we need to consider other
                  explanations. We
	would suggest the following: Therapeutic impotence: Doctors,
                  especially
	specialists feel they need to do something, and prescribing a
                  familiar
	drug is the easiest option. Ignorance: Doctors are either
                  unaware
	of the substantial evidence of harm with neuroleptics or are
                  swayed
	by slick marketing information, portraying atypical
                  neuroleptics
	in an "over-safe" light that does not reflect the actual
                  data. Placebo
	effect: If neuroleptics are prescribed, the majority of
                  patients
	experience an improvement in BPSD symptoms. This reinforces
                  the apparent
	value of this practice, as we like to take the credit for any
                  improvements
	that occur. The reality is that the majority of people would
                  have
	experienced a comparable improvement with monitoring. Bowing
                  to pressure:
	Sometimes the pressure to respond can be great, and a
                  prescription
	is an easy way to relieve the pressure. This is
                  understandable, and
	reflects a similar phenomenon to that of general practioners
                  prescribing
	antibiotics for sore throats. In neither situation does it
                  represent
	good practice. Lack of skills to implement non-pharmacological
                  alternatives:
	The main evidence for alternative treatment options are for
                  therapies
	that by and large are not a core part of the physician or
                  psychiatrist's
	skill-base, such as psychological interventions. Doctors
                  therefore
	feel uncomfortable pursuing these options. Why for example is
                  so
	little time spent on the nonpharmacological interventions that
                  everyone
	agrees should be the first line of treatment for BPSD in
                  people with
	dementia? It is largely assumed that the "enlightened
                  clinician has
	already appropriately assessed and diagnosed the patient and
                  exhausted
	all the possible environmental and behavioral interventions
                  before
	resorting to the prescription pad." Accumulating evidence
                  clearly
	indicates that the need for psychotropic medication is
                  substantially
	reduced by proactive services or interventions which can
                  provide
	training and promote psychological, social and environmental
                  and
	sensory interventions. The prescription but is an easy but not
                  an
	acceptable alternative. Over-adherence to prescribing
                  guidance: There
	are pharmacological alternatives to neuroleptics if a
                  prescription
	is needed. Although the evidence for the more promising
                  alternatives
	needs to be developed much further, drugs such as
                  cholinesterase
	inhibitors may offer a much less harmful alternative. The
                  reluctance
	of clinicians to use cholinesterase inhibitors in this way is
                  puzzling,
	and presumably is because of the culture of
                  "guidance-prescribing"
	that has evolved around these agents. If the treatment of BPSD
                  is
	to move forward, we need to challenge the way we have always
                  done
	things, examine the evidence and move forward with new and
                  flexible
	multi-disciplinary approaches if we are truly to look after
                  the "best
	interests of our patients".},

                  can be effective
	treatments for certain behaviour disorders such as alcoholism
                  (Ashem
	and Donner, 1968) and sexual deviation (Feldman and
                  MacCulloch, 1971).
	However, the mechanism of action in the various forms of
                  aversion
	therapy has not been determined. As one form of aversion
                  therapy,
	covert sensitization employs descriptions of noxious scenes as
                  aversive
	stimuli. An earlier study (Barlow, Leitenberg and Agras, 1969)
                  suggested
	that pairing descriptions of noxious scenes with scenes of the
                  undesired
	behavior was the critical procedure in covert
                  sensitization. There,
	a single case design was used with two sexual
                  deviates. Sexually
	arousing scenes were paired with descriptions of nausea and
                  vomiting
	during the first phase, while in a second phase the same
                  sexually
	arousing scenes were presented alone, and finally, pairing was
                  reinstated.
	Put another way, these phases represent acquisition,
                  extinction and
	re-acquisition respectively. During the pairing of scenes in
                  the
	first phase, deviant arousal declined, rose again when the
                  pairing
	of scenes was removed, and dropped in the final phase when
                  pairing
	was reinstated. This appeared to demonstrate the effectiveness
                  of
	pairing in the procedure. It is possible, however, that
                  therapeutic
	instructions and the resulting expectancy of improvement
                  present
	in both covert sensitization phases, were responsible for the
                  effectiveness
	of the treatment, since the patient may have viewed the middle
                  extinction
	phase as non- therapeutic. To test this notion, the procedure
                  of
	the first experiment was changed somewhat. Four homosexual Ss
                  were
	told that the acquisition procedure (covert sensitization)
                  with pairing
	would temporarily worsen their sexual deviation and that the
                  extinction
	procedure (no pairing) was therapeutic. The experiment began
                  with
	the no pairing procedure with therapeutic instructions to
                  create
	the desired expectancies at the outset and to test for an
                  initial
	placebo effect. In addition, an objective measure of sexual
                  arousal,
	penile circumference change, was recorded. If pairing is the
                  necessary
	and sufficient procedure in covert sensitization, then deviant
                  sexual
	arousal should decrease during covert sensitization despite
                  instructions
	to the contrary and, conversely, no improvement should occur
                  during
	the no pairing, placebo phase.},

  abstract = {A theory of hypnosis based mainly on principles of
                  conditioning and
	inhibition is proposed, covering the hypnotic induction
                  process,
	hypnotic phenomena and post-hypnotic phenomena. The overall
                  explanation
	presented is delineated in a set of three initial postulates
                  and
	seven subsequent hypotheses. Hypnotic induction is defined as
                  the
	giving of a series of suggestions so that a positive response
                  to
	a previous suggestion conditions the subject to respond more
                  strongly
	to the next suggestion. This induction process is placed in a
                  conditioning
	paradigm, with the condition stimulus (CS), unconditioned
                  stimulus
	(UCS), conditioned response (CR) and unconditioned response
                  (UCR),
	trials and reinforcement clearly delineated. Summarized in
                  brief,
	hypnotic induction is explained as the conditioning of an
                  inhibitory
	set, a set which increases responsiveness to suggestion by
                  inhibiting
	stimuli and thoughts which would contradict the suggested
                  response.
	The various hypnotic and post-hypnotic phenomena are explained
                  in
	terms of this set. Post-hypnotic behaviour changes are further
                  explained
	as produced through a process of higherorder conditioning;
                  hypnosis
	facilitates such conditioning thanks to the inhibitory act
                  which
	suppresses any interfering stimuli. The theory may be broad
                  enough
	to cover not only hypnosis but also related areas such as
                  persuasion,
	the placebo effect and faith. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright

                  merely the random
	firing of neurons in the brain? Drawing on his own research
                  with
	Carmelite nuns, neuroscientist Mario Beauregard shows that
                  genuine,
	life-changing spiritual events can be documented. He offers
                  compelling
	evidence that religious experiences have a nonmaterial origin,
                  making
	a convincing case for what many in scientific fields are loath
                  to
	consider--that it is God who creates our spiritual
                  experiences, not
	the brain. Beauregard and O'Leary explore recent attempts to
                  locate
	a "God gene" in some of us and claims that our brains are
                  "hardwired"
	for religion--even the strange case of one neuroscientist who
                  allegedly
	invented an electromagnetic "God helmet" that could produce a
                  mystical
	experience in anyone who wore it. The authors argue that these
                  attempts
	are misguided and narrow-minded, because they reduce spiritual
                  experiences
	to material phenomena. Many scientists ignore hard evidence
                  that
	challenges their materialistic prejudice, clinging to the
                  limited
	view that our experiences are explainable only by material
                  causes,
	in the obstinate conviction that the physical world is the
                  only reality.
	But scientific materialism is at a loss to explain irrefutable
                  accounts
	of mind over matter, of intuition, willpower, and leaps of
                  faith,
	of the "placebo effect" in medicine, of near-death experiences
                  on
	the operating table, and of psychic premonitions of a loved
                  one in
	crisis, to say nothing of the occasional sense of oneness with
                  nature
	and mystical experiences in meditation or prayer. Traditional
                  science
	explains away these and other occurrences as delusions or
                  misunderstandings,
	but by exploring the latest neurological research on phenomena

	Forty-two team-sport athletes were randomly assigned to 2

	All subjects completed 3 x 30-m baseline sprint trials after
                  which
	they were administered what was described to them as an
                  ergogenic
	aid but was in fact 200 mg of cornstarch in a gelatin
                  capsule. Group
	1 was provided with positive information about the likely

	on performance of the substance, whereas Group 2 was provided
                  with
	negative information about the same substance. The sprint

                  that

                  recognized. In fact,
	central nervous system (CNS)-body interactions can influence
                  health,
	fertility, and even life span itself. We suggest that the
                  placebo
	response might have been of importance in the evolution of the
                  human
	species, once brain development reached a certain level. Some
                  individuals
	may have positively responded to the placebo given by a
                  primordial
	healer or by themselves, and markedly increased their health
                  and
	well-being. Those individuals may have had an evolutionary
                  advantage
	due to increased fertility, better physical performance and
                  increased
	life span. We consider this enhanced "CNS-body
                  interactions/placebo
	sensitivity" a biological trait that has been selected for
                  through
	time. Being this a genetic trait, it is susceptible to bear
                  polymorphisms

	and neurophysiological mechanisms and their neuroanatomical
                  localization.
	Nevertheless, the neurobiological acquisitions on these

	that the term placebo effect is too restrictive and, in fact,
                  many
	placebo-related effects have recently been investigated. A
                  placebo
	effect differs from a placebo-like effect in that the former
                  follows
	the administration of a placebo, whereas in the latter no
                  placebo
	is administered. However, in both cases, the psychosocial
                  context
	around the treatment plays a key role. In recent years,
                  placebo and
	placebo-related effects have been analyzed with sophisticated
                  biological
	tools that have uncovered specific mechanisms at both the
                  biochemical
	and cellular level. This recent research has revealed that
                  these
	psychosocial-induced biochemical changes in a patient's brain
                  and

	is important to understand that a placebo procedure simulates
                  a therapy
	through the surrounding psychosocial context. Therefore, the
                  study
	of the placebo effect is the study of the psychosocial context

	the patient and its effects on the

                  due
	to different mechanisms, for example expectation and
                  conditioning.
	Thus, there is not a single placebo effect but many, so that

	represents an important step in understanding the mechanisms
                  underlying
	placebo response. In the present study, we investigated the
                  effects
	of the opiate antagonist naloxone and the cholecystokinin
                  antagonist
	proglumide on placebo analgesia in a human model of
                  experimentally
	induced ischemic pain. First, we found that part of the
                  placebo response
	was reversed by naloxone, confirming previous studies on the
                  role
	of opioids in the placebo phenomenon. Second, since it was
                  demonstrated
	that the action of exogenous and endogenous opiates is
                  potentiated
	by proglumide, we analysed the effects of this cholecystokinin
                  antagonist
	on placebo response and found that it enhanced placebo
                  analgesia.
	The placebo effect can thus be modulated in two opposite
                  directions:
	it can be partially abolished by naloxone and potentiated by
                  proglumide.
	The fact that placebo potentiation by proglumide occurred only
                  in
	placebo responders, but not in non-responders, suggests that
                  activation
	of an endogenous opiate system is a necessary condition for
                  the action
	of proglumide. These results suggest an inhibitory role for
                  cholecystokinin
	in placebo response, although the low affinity of proglumide
                  for
	cholecystokinin receptors does not rule out the possibility of
                  other

  abstract = {Placebo is a widespread phenomenon in medicine and
                  biology and its
	mechanisms are understood only partially. Most of our
                  understanding
	of placebo comes from studies on pain. In particular, placebo
                  analgesia
	represents a situation where the administration of a substance
                  known
	to be non-analgesic produces an analgesic response when the
                  subject
	is told that it is a painkiller. Several theories try to
                  explain
	this effect by means of anxiety mechanisms, cognitive
                  processes and
	classical conditioning. However, the placebo response is
                  bidirectional,
	i.e. analgesic and algesic. In fact, if a subject is told that
                  the
	ineffective substance is a hyperalgesic drug, a pain increase
                  may
	occur. The negative effects of placebo are called nocebo and,
                  in
	extreme cases, they lead to severe pathological
                  conditions. The neurobiology
	of placebo was born when some authors discovered that placebo
                  analgesia
	is mediated by endogenous opioids. This claim comes from the
                  observation
	that the opioid antagonist naloxone can reverse placebo
                  analgesia.
	On the basis of the discovery of the anti-opioid action of the
                  neuropeptide
	cholecystokinin, recent studies demonstrate that the blockade
                  of
	cholecystokinin receptors potentiates the placebo analgesic
                  response,
	thus suggesting an inhibitory role of cholecystokinin in
                  placebo
	analgesia. Thus, by antagonizing the anti-opioid action of
                  cholecystokinin
	during a placebo procedure, a potentiation of the endogenous
                  opioid
	systems can be obtained. Â© 1997 Elsevier Science

                  times, little
	is known about the nocebo effect, a phenomenon that is
                  opposite to
	the placebo effect and whereby expectations of symptom
                  worsening
	play a crucial role. By studying experimental ischemic arm
                  pain in
	healthy volunteers and by using a neuropharmacological
                  approach,
	we found that verbally induced nocebo hyperalgesia was
                  associated
	to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
                  axis,
	as assessed by means of adrenocorticotropic hormone and
                  cortisol
	plasma concentrations. Both nocebo hyperalgesia and HPA
                  hyperactivity
	were antagonized by the benzodiazepine diazepam, suggesting
                  that
	anxiety played a major role in these effects. The
                  administration
	of the mixed cholecystokinin (CCK) type-A/B receptor
                  antagonist proglumide
	blocked nocebo hyperalgesia completely but had no effect on
                  HPA hyperactivity,
	which suggests a specific involvement of CCK in the
                  hyperalgesic
	but not in the anxiety component of the nocebo
                  effect. Importantly,
	both diazepam and proglumide did not show analgesic properties
                  on
	basal pain, because they acted only on the nocebo-induced pain
                  increase.
	These data indicate a close relationship between anxiety and
                  nocebo
	hyperalgesia, in which the CCKergic systems play a key role in
                  anxiety-induced
	hyperalgesia. These results, together with previous findings
                  showing
	that placebo analgesia is mediated by endogenous opioids,
                  suggest
	that the analgesic placebo/hyperalgesic nocebo phenomenon may
                  involve
	the opposite activation of endogenous opioidergic and CCKergic
                  systems.

                  sensation. Specific
	expectations of analgesia were induced by applying a placebo
                  cream
	on one of these body parts and by telling the subjects that it
                  was
	a powerful local anesthetic. In such a way, expectancy of the
                  anesthetic
	effect was directed only toward the part on which the placebo
                  cream
	was applied. We found that a placebo analgesic response
                  occurred
	only on the treated part, whereas no variation in pain
                  sensitivity
	was found on the untreated parts. If the same experiment was
                  performed
	after an intravenous infusion of the opioid antagonist
                  naloxone,
	this highly spatial-specific placebo response was totally
                  abolished,
	indicating that it was completely mediated by endogenous
                  opioid systems.
	These findings show that a spatially directed expectation of
                  pain
	reduction is capable of inducing a specific effect only on the
                  part
	of the body which is the target of the expectation. Most
                  important,
	this specific effect is mediated by endogenous opioids,
                  indicating
	that placebo-activated opioids do not act on the entire body
                  but
	only on the part where expectancy is directed. This suggests
                  that
	a highly organized and somatotopic network of endogenous
                  opioids
	links expectation, attention, and body schema.},

                  effects of therapies
	show additive effects, such that a therapy is less effective
                  if the
	placebo component is absent. So far, the placebo component has
                  been
	disrupted experimentally by using covert administrations of
                  treatments.
	Here, we show for the first time that disruption of
                  expectation/placebo-related
	analgesic mechanisms may occur in a clinical condition,
                  Alzheimer's
	disease (AD). In order to assess the placebo component of a
                  therapy,
	we used the recently developed open-hidden paradigm. A local
                  anesthetic
	was applied, either overtly or covertly, to the skin of AD
                  patients
	to reduce burning pain after venipuncture. The placebo
                  (psychological)
	component is represented by the difference between the
                  analgesic
	effect after open (expected) and after hidden (unexpected)
                  application.
	We correlated the placebo component with both cognitive status
                  and
	functional connectivity among different brain regions. We
                  found that
	AD patients with reduced Frontal Assessment Battery scores
                  showed
	reduced placebo component of the analgesic treatment. We also
                  found
	that the disruption of the placebo component occurred when
                  reduced
	connectivity of the prefrontal lobes with the rest of the
                  brain was
	present. Remarkably, the loss of these placebo-related
                  mechanisms
	reduced treatment efficacy, such that a dose increase was
                  necessary
	to produce adequate analgesia. These findings highlight the
                  active
	role of cognition and prefrontal lobes in the therapeutic
                  outcome
	and underscore the need of considering a possible revision of
                  the
	therapeutic approach in Alzheimer patients in order to
                  compensate
	for the loss of the endogenous expectation and placebo

	of a therapy is likely to come from the experimental setting

	effect on some physiological processes, for example, hormone
                  secretion.
	Third, the open-hidden paradigm is difficult to be applied in

                  has shown
	that placebos can activate the endogenous opioid systems in
                  some
	conditions. So far, the impact of this finding has been within
                  the
	context of the clinical setting. Here we present an experiment
                  that
	simulates a sport competition, a situation in which opioids
                  are considered
	to be illegal drugs. After repeated administrations of
                  morphine in
	the precompetition training phase, its replacement with a
                  placebo
	on the day of competition induced an opioid-mediated increase
                  of
	pain endurance and physical performance, although no illegal
                  drug
	was administered. The placebo analgesic responses were
                  obtained after
	two morphine administrations that were separated as long as 1
                  week
	from each other. These long time intervals indicate that the
                  pharmacological
	conditioning procedure has long-lasting effects and that
                  opioid-mediated
	placebo responses may have practical implications and
                  applications.
	For example, in the context of the present sport simulation,
                  athletes
	can be preconditioned with morphine and then a placebo can be
                  given
	just before competition, thus avoiding administration of the
                  illegal
	drug on the competition day. However, these morphine-like
                  effects
	of placebos raise the important question whether
                  opioid-mediated
	placebo responses are ethically acceptable in sport
                  competitions
	or whether they have to be considered a doping procedure in
                  all respects.

	suggestions on experimental ischemic arm pain in healthy
                  volunteers
	and on motor performance in Parkinsonian patients. The results
                  show
	that verbally induced expectations of analgesia/hyperalgesia
                  and
	motor improvement/worsening antagonized completely the effects

                  effects of
	opposing verbal suggestions on hormonal secretion and found
                  that
	verbally induced expectations of increase/decrease of growth

	subjects. In four previously reported experiments on anomalous
                  healing
	using "healing with intent" on mice injected with lethal doses
                  of
	mammary adenocarcinoma (source, The Jackson Laboratories, Bar
                  Harbor,
	ME; code, H2712; host strain, C3H/HeJ), a high percentage of
                  both
	experimental and control mice exhibited an anomalous healing
                  pattern,
	most often passing through stages of tumor ulceration to full
                  life-span
	cure. Objective: In order to explain tumor regression of
                  control
	animals, I posit the formation of "resonant bonds," which can
                  link
	spatially separate groups. Healing given to the experimental
                  animals
	can result in an unintended treatment to the control animals,
                  producing
	anomalous healing akin to placebo effects. Materials and
                  methods:
	A recently completed experiment at the Terre Haute campus of
                  the
	Indiana University School of Medicine has produced a
                  successful test
	of resonance theory. One group of mice (n = 30) was injected
                  with
	mammary adenocarcinoma cells and randomly divided into a
                  treated
	group (n = 15) and untreated control group (n = 15). A second
                  group
	of age-matched controls (n = 25) was left uninjected. Mice
                  from each
	group were intermittently sacrificed to measure hematologic
                  values
	and spleen weight. Results: As predicted by resonance theory,
                  there
	were few differences between treated and untreated animals
                  from the
	first group, but there were significant differences between
                  these
	animals and the age-matched controls. Conclusions: Some
                  implications
	for placebo research and the way we normally conceptualize
                  Type II
	errors will be discussed. Researchers are invited to reanalyze
                  past
	data in light of resonance theory. (PsycINFO Database Record

	The author showed that the price consumers pay for a beverage
                  not
	only affects the perceived benefit from the product but also
                  extends
	to actual performance on puzzle-solving tasks. Placebo effects
                  that
	manifest as changes in subjective state (e.g., mood, aesthetic
                  ratings)
	are one thing, but when the effect extends to behavior, the
                  placebo
	passes out of the realm of being "all in the head" and into
                  something
	real and measurable. As Shiv, Carmon, and Ariely suggest, the
                  price
	of the product affects performance through the commonly known
                  placebo
	effect. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is
                  beginning
	to provide a window into how these processes function in the
                  brain.
	Even without placebos, mere expectation alters the processing
                  of
	tactile stimuli. In the brain, however, salient stimuli elicit
                  changes
	in several systems, including the parietal attention system
                  and subcortical
	dopamine system. In Shiv, Carmon, and Ariely's study, it can
                  be inferred
	that price was a salient piece of information because it
                  affected
	behavior. If Shiv, Carmon, and Ariely's results were extended
                  to
	such a realm, this would imply that discount drug policies may
                  actually
	impair the efficacy of certain medications. (PsycINFO Database

	and in clinical trials. In this report the nature of placebo
                  is explored
	in general and in relation to gastrointestinal diseases. The
                  goodness
	of placebo is highlighted. PubMed was searched for articles
                  and commentaries
	on placebo and for systematic reviews on placebo. Selected
                  placebo-controlled
	trials in gastroenterology were reviewed. There are 5 key
                  components
	impacting the placebo response: patient characteristics,
                  practitioner
	characteristics, practitioner-patient interaction, the nature
                  of
	the illness being treated, and the treatment being applied and
                  the
	setting in which it is applied. There are also a number of
                  factors
	that constitute the placebo response and likely all apply to
                  some
	extent. These include the natural history of the condition, a
                  regression
	to the mean (accounting for fluctuation in measurements over
                  time),
	other time effects (ie, patient learning to cope, practitioner
                  gaining
	expertise), unidentified parallel interventions (ie, change in
                  habits

                  agent
	being compared with placebo, and the physiologic effects of
                  the placebo.
	In summary, there are positive aspects to placebo. Clinicians
                  treating
	patients with gastrointestinal diseases can harness aspects of
                  the
	placebo response to improve patient outcomes. Clinical trial
                  planners
	can harness aspects of the placebo response to design

                  working in

                  completed a
	questionnaire on the placebo effect in the treatment of

	The patients believed that the percentages of subjects who
                  responded
	occasionally or consistently to a placebo were 32% (+/- 22%)
                  and

                  were
	only slightly higher: 42% (+/- 23%) and 23% (+/- 17%),
                  respectively.
	Only 27% of the patients and 58% of the nurses knew that pain
                  could

                  antidepressant
	effects. They distinguish among response to treatment,
                  treatment
	effect, placebo response, and placebo effect. In each case,
                  response
	defines the total amount of change associated with the
                  implementation
	of a treatment or placebo, as effect defines that portion of
                  the
	response that can be attributed to the medication or
                  placebo. They
	suggest that the field ignored the overshadowing role of the
                  relative
	size of placebo and treatment effects in its rush to acclaim
                  the
	effectiveness of antidepressants. They suggest that the
                  inclusion
	of a proportional measure that describes the relative amount
                  of change
	that is distributed to active treatment effects and placebo
                  response
	will help balance presentations on the effects of
                  treatments. The
	results have broader and more important implications than

	by the authors, extending to prescription practices, how
                  depression
	is conceptualized within a diagnostic perspective, to the
                  concept
	of treatment-induced deterioration effects. The poor showing

	both in this and other meta-analyses, raises questions about

                  of the cognitive
	modulation of pain perception and the underlying mechanisms
                  are finally
	beginning to be understood. According to pharmacological
                  studies,
	the endogenous opioid system is essential for placebo
                  analgesia.
	Recent functional imaging data provides evidence that the
                  rostral
	anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) represents a crucial cortical
                  area
	for this type of endogenous pain control. We therefore
                  hypothesized
	that placebo analgesia recruits other brain areas outside the
                  rACC
	and that interactions of the rACC with these brain areas
                  mediate
	opioid-dependent endogenous antinociception as part of a
                  top-down
	mechanism. Nineteen healthy subjects received and rated
                  painful laser
	stimuli to the dorsum of both hands, one of them treated with
                  a fake
	analgesic cream (placebo). Painful stimulation was preceded by
                  an
	auditory cue, indicating the side of the next laser
                  stimulation.
	BOLD-responses to the painful laser-stimulation during the
                  placebo
	and no-placebo condition were assessed using event-related
                  fMRI.
	After having confirmed placebo related activity in the rACC, a
                  connectivity
	analysis identified placebo dependent contributions of rACC
                  activity
	with bilateral amygdalae and the periaqueductal gray
                  (PAG). This
	finding supports the view that placebo analgesia depends on
                  the enhanced
	functional connectivity of the rACC with subcortical brain
                  structures
	that are crucial for conditioned learning and descending

	contain a two-edged bias, understating the placebo effect and

                  the

	of the truly remarkable discoveries in modern biology is the
                  finding
	that the nervous system and immune system use a common
                  chemical language
	for intra- and inter-system communication. This review will
                  discuss
	some of the pivotal results that deciphered this chemical
                  language.
	Specifically the nervous and immune systems produce a common
                  set
	of peptide and nonpeptide neurotransmitters and cytokines that
                  act
	on a common repertoire of receptors in the two systems. The
                  paper
	will also review more recent studies that have delineated
                  hardwired
	and humoral pathways for such bidirectional
                  communication. This is
	discussed in the context of the idea that the sharing of
                  ligands
	and receptors allows the immune system to serve as the sixth
                  sense
	that notifies the nervous system of the presence of entities,
                  such
	as viruses and bacteria, that are imperceptible to the classic
                  senses.
	Lastly, this review will suggest ways to apply the newfound
                  knowledge
	of the sixth sense to understand a placebo effect and to
                  treate human
	disease. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of

  abstract = {Presents an article about the placebo response with
                  respect to pain
	and analgesia. The placebo response is related to a person's
                  perceptions
	of how things will affect him or her either as a benefit or
                  through
	perceived reward value. The most obvious difference between
                  placebo
	effects on behavior in pain and analgesia and on behavior in
                  product
	choice is that in the former, an endogenous opioid system is
                  well
	defined and can orchestrate a biological basis for analgesia
                  in a
	placebo response. In nonpain responses, other systems must be
                  invoked
	for the placebo response to occur. Some experiments produce
                  negative
	placebo response resulting from price discounting. The
                  undesirable
	effect may be the result of "greater dissonance," such that
                  the participants
	wonder whether the low cost of the product is related to a
                  lower
	quality or efficacy of the product, thus contradicting its
                  purported
	benefits. The cost of a product can affect the outcome of the
                  use
	of the product. In marketing's effect on the placebo response,
                  expectation
	is predominant, but it is unclear how unconscious systems
                  influence
	the response. The ability to predict the likelihood of an
                  aversive
	(pain) or rewarding (analgesic) event is an important adaptive
                  capacity.
	The placebo effect may cause disease to fluctuate; pain may be
                  worse

	Quality of life (Qol) measures are particularly subject to

                  the extent

                  number of
	clinical trials for treatment of women's sexual
                  dysfunction. Studying
	placebo responses may elucidate predictors of symptom
                  reduction and
	responsiveness to intervention. AIM: To determine the
                  correlates
	of placebo response in participants enrolled in a clinical
                  trial
	for female sexual dysfunction. METHODS: We analyzed data from
                  16
	women with sexual arousal and orgasmic dysfunction who were
                  randomized
	to receive 8 weeks of placebo treatment within a larger
                  randomized
	controlled trial. Using nonparametric correlations, we tested
                  whether
	age, length of relationship, psychological symptoms, and
                  scores on
	self-report measures predicted change in sexual function with
                  placebo
	treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Female Sexual Function
                  Index. RESULTS:
	Consistent with findings from other studies, we found a
                  significant
	improvement in sexual function scores after 8 weeks of
                  treatment
	with placebo. We also found that age and length of
                  relationship predicted
	the magnitude of change in sexual function across
                  treatment. Changes
	in relationship adjustment, but not relationship adjustment at
                  baseline,
	predicted the magnitude of improvement in sexual function
                  scores.
	We observed no relationship between psychological symptom
                  severity
	and change in sexual function. CONCLUSIONS: Participant age
                  and length
	of relationship predicted subsequent magnitude of change in
                  sexual
	function scores during treatment with placebo. In addition,
                  relationship
	adjustment covaried with changes in sexual function. Our
                  findings
	suggest that "placebo effects" may represent underlying
                  factors that

  abstract = {There is increasing interest in the empirical effects of
                  prayer on
	health. However, little attention has been paid to the
                  theoretical
	causal mechanisms by which health may be affected by prayer. A
                  critical
	examination of extant literature on the psychology of prayer
                  was
	conducted to identify potential ways in which prayer may act
                  to promote
	health. The review suggested that an array of prayer types
                  exist
	ranging from prayers of attunement to petitionary
                  prayers. Additionally,
	prayer may affect health by a variety of means including: (a)
                  prayer
	may improve health because of the placebo effect; (b)
                  individuals
	who pray may also engage in health-related behaviour; (c)
                  prayer
	may help by diverting attention from health problems; (d)
                  prayer
	may promote health through supernatural intervention by God;
                  (e)
	prayer may activate latent energies, such as chi, which have
                  not
	been empirically verified, but which nevertheless may be
                  beneficial
	to health; and (f) prayer may result in a unity of
                  consciousness
	which facilitates the transmission of healing between
                  individuals.
	An agreement among researchers about the classification and
                  measurement
	of prayer might result in an easier comparison of results
                  across
	studies. Researchers should be aware of the many prayer types
                  documented
	in the literature and should select a measure of prayer
                  appropriate
	to their field of investigation. Additionally, researchers
                  should
	give consideration to the possible causal mechanisms
                  underlying the
	hypotheses they are investigating. Furthermore, if researchers
                  offer
	some theoretically based argument, regarding prayer, for the
                  hypotheses
	that they are testing, then results from studies involving
                  prayer
	may be more meaningful. Having established the theoretical
                  models
	of the ways in which prayer may promote better health, the
                  challenge
	for psychology is to provide empirical evidence to confirm or
                  disconfirm
	the alternate hypotheses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of

	Coordinated interdisciplinary research into the placebo

  abstract = {The potential of placebo treatments to alleviate a
                  variety of medical
	conditions has long been recognised. Although the placebo
                  effect
	is widely known, the physiological mechanisms underlying this
                  phenomenon
	are not well understood. This review focuses on the existing
                  evidence
	for placebo responses in different neurological conditions,
                  including
	pain, Parkinson's disease, depression, sleep and
                  immune-mediated
	disorders. Special attention is paid to the neural changes
                  associated
	with placebo treatments, as revealed by in vivo
                  neurophysiologlcal
	and functional neuroimaging studies. Converging evidence
                  suggests
	that placebo analgesia is linked to the activation of the
                  endogenous
	opioid analgesia network, whilst dopaminergic pathways seem to
                  play
	a central role in the placebo effect in movement disorders and
                  neuroimmunomodulation.
	Further research on the placebo response is needed, both to

	the undeniable therapeutic results of placebo therapy cannot

  abstract = {Objectives: Placebo effects have been suggested to be
                  more potent
	on clinical than experimental pain. However, this proposition
                  is
	based on the comparison of the magnitude of placebo analgesia
                  between
	studies using different methodologies or between different
                  groups
	of subjects within the same study. The authors sought to
                  provide
	a more direct test of this hypothesis using a within-subject
                  design
	and to investigate the potential mediating effect of
                  expectancy.
	Method: Sixteen patients with low back pain rated the
                  intensity and
	the unpleasantness of their clinical pain and underwent two
                  cold
	pressor tests, both before and after a saline injection
                  presented
	either as a potent painkiller (placebo treatment) in one
                  session
	or as an inactive substance in a control session. Results: The
                  placebo
	treatment produced comparable increases in expected relief for
                  clinical
	and experimental pain. However, ratings of pain intensity,
                  pain unpleasantness,
	and perceived relief confirmed the larger placebo effect in
                  low back
	pain than cold pressor pain. Retrospective ratings of
                  perceived relief
	in low back pain generally showed the largest placebo effect
                  compared
	with concurrent pain ratings. Furthermore, when the placebo
                  session
	was performed after the control session, the placebo effect on
                  low
	back pain was substantially reduced and observed only in
                  perceived
	relief. Variations in expectation could not account for the
                  large
	difference in placebo analgesia between clinical and
                  experimental
	pain. Conclusions: The important reduction in placebo
                  analgesia in
	low back pain after the single pre-exposure to the ineffective
                  control
	treatment suggests the additional involvement of highly
                  flexible
	mechanisms that may counteract the pro-analgesic effects of
                  expectations.

  abstract = {Comments on an article by Simpson et al. (see record
                  2006-08831-001)
	regarding the association between adherence to drug therapy
                  and mortality.
	Simpson and colleagues report their systematic review's
                  finding that
	good adherence to placebos as well as to drug treatments is
                  associated
	with reduced mortality. They hypothesize that this intriguing
                  finding
	supports the concept of the "healthy adherer" effect, whereby
                  adherence
	to drug treatment may be a surrogate marker for overall
                  healthy behaviour.
	The current author notes that the potential potential benefits
                  of
	any new treatment regimen arise in the context of patients'
                  powerful
	lifestyle habits and resources, as well as their health status
                  and
	their histories of health behaviour. In addition, a patient
                  brings
	to each brief meeting with a doctor their habits for drug
                  adherence.
	It is quite possible, therefore, that people who adhere to
                  healthy
	lifestyles also tend to take care of themselves by greater
                  adherence
	to prescribed treatments. Evidence on the placebo effect
                  yields a
	complementary hypothesis, for the association between
                  adherence to
	placebo and reduced mortality. The association with lower
                  mortality
	in the paper by Simpson and colleagues could arise from
                  positive
	interaction between these healthy adherer and placebo related
                  effects.
	The author discusses what these hypotheses imply for doctors'
                  decisions
	and the encounters they have with patients. (PsycINFO Database

                  aftereffect
	of individuals learning of a personal placebo response on
                  their future
	ability to experience a placebo response. In the first study,
                  eleven
	participants diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome in a
                  placebo
	study were interviewed individually about their personal
                  placebo
	response. We found no changes in attitudes about the
                  likelihood of
	using medical and non-medical treatments for pain, likelihood
                  of
	participating in future studies or likeability and trust of
                  experimenters.
	In addition, we found no changes in mood except for a slight
                  improvement
	in frustration. In the second study, 77 undergraduate students
                  from
	the University of Florida were divided into three conditions:
                  placebo,
	control and repeated baseline. We used a double placebo design
                  with
	verbal placebo suggestion and conditioning to induce a placebo
                  response
	and to examine the effect of providing information about a
                  participant's
	personal placebo response on their future placebo
                  response. Using
	a heat thermode, we discovered that there were no differences
                  in
	future pain responding between participants who were told that
                  they
	experienced a placebo response versus those who were not. In
                  addition,
	similar to the first study, we found no detrimental effects of
                  the
	placebo information variables measured. These studies suggest
                  the
	placebo response persists even after revelation of a personal
                  placebo
	response and placebo use does not appear to cause adverse
                  effects
	on mood and other attitude variables assessed.},

                  study
	appear to highlight one biochemical mechanism that may
                  contribute
	to the placebo effect. Serotonin seems to be, at least in
                  part, one
	neurotransmitter responsible for actuation of the placebo
                  effect
	in the treatment of menstrual migraines. Fifteen trials were

	6 with placebo and 9 with sumatriptan. This study presents
                  data that
	support the biologic existence of the placebo effect. The
                  first significant
	discovery concerns the initial serotonin level of the placebo
                  responders.
	Secondly, the 5-HT level of the placebo-nonresponders is

	levels of the patients who received sumatriptan remained

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous report, we hypothesized that
                  responses to
	placebo were high in child and adolescent depression because
                  of specific
	psychopathological factors associated with youth major
                  depression.
	The purpose of this study was to compare the placebo response
                  rates
	in pharmacological trials for major depressive disorder (MDD),
                  obsessive
	compulsive disorder (OCD) and other anxiety disorders
                  (AD-non-OCD).
	METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We reviewed the literature
                  relevant
	to the use of psychotropic medication in children and
                  adolescents
	with internalized disorders, restricting our review to
                  double-blind
	studies including a placebo arm. Placebo response rates were
                  pooled
	and compared according to diagnosis (MDD vs. OCD
                  vs. AD-non-OCD),
	age (adolescent vs. child), and date of publication. From 1972
                  to
	2007, we found 23 trials that evaluated the efficacy of
                  psychotropic
	medication (mainly non-tricyclic antidepressants) involving
                  youth
	with MDD, 7 pertaining to youth with OCD, and 10 pertaining to
                  youth
	with other anxiety disorders (N = 2533 patients in placebo
                  arms).
	As hypothesized, the placebo response rate was significantly
                  higher
	in studies on MDD, than in those examining OCD and AD-non-OCD
                  (49.6%
	[range: 17-90%] vs. 31% [range: 4-41%] vs. 39.6% [range:
                  9-53], respectively,
	ANOVA F = 7.1, p = 0.002). Children showed a higher stable
                  placebo
	response within all three diagnoses than adolescents, though
                  this
	difference was not significant. Finally, no significant
                  effects were
	found with respect to the year of publication. CONCLUSION: MDD
                  in
	children and adolescents appears to be more responsive to
                  placebo
	than other internalized conditions, which highlights

  number = {5},
  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nocebo hyperalgesia is a phenomenon
                  that is opposite
	to placebo analgesia and whereby expectation of pain increase
                  plays
	a crucial role. In recent times, both the neuroanatomical and
                  the
	neurochemical bases of the nocebo effect and of nocebo-related
                  effects
	have begun to be explored. Here, we highlight recent advances
                  in
	our understanding of the neurobiology of the nocebo
                  hyperalgesic
	effect. RECENT FINDINGS: A typical nocebo hyperalgesic
                  response occurs
	following the administration of an inert substance which the
                  subject
	believes to be a hyperalgesic agent (negative placebo or
                  nocebo).
	It has been shown that the subject's negative expectations of
                  pain
	worsening induce anticipatory anxiety about the impending pain
                  increase
	and this triggers the activation of cholecystokinin that, in
                  turn,
	facilitates pain transmission. Accordingly, cholecystokinin
                  antagonists
	have been found to prevent this anxiety-induced
                  hyperalgesia. Brain-imaging
	studies have shown that the perceived intensity of a painful
                  stimulus
	following negative expectations of pain increase is higher
                  than in
	the absence of negative expectations and this is associated
                  with
	changes in activation of specific brain regions. SUMMARY:
                  Since pain
	appears to be amplified by anxiety through the activation of
                  cholecystokininergic
	systems, new therapeutic strategies, such as new
                  cholecystokinin
	antagonists, can be envisaged whenever pain has an important
                  anxiety
	component.},

	practice. It occurs in 10 to 20% of the population, but less
                  than
	half seek medical assistance with the complaint. METHODS: A
                  questionnaire
	was sent to the 406 GPs listed on the West Sussex Health
                  Authority
	Medical List to investigate their views of this condition and
                  whether
	they felt hypnotherapy had a place in its management RESULTS:
                  38%
	of general practitioners responded. The achieved sample shared
                  the
	characteristics of target sample.Nearly half thought that
                  irritable
	bowel syndrome (IBS) was a "nervous complaint" and used a
                  combination
	of "the placebo effect of personal care," therapeutic, and
                  dietary
	advice. There is considerable divergence in the perceived
                  effectiveness
	of current approaches. Over 70% thought that hypnotherapy may
                  have
	a role in the management of patients with IBS; though the
                  majority
	(68%) felt that this should not be offered by general
                  practitioners.
	84% felt that this should be offered by qualified
                  hypnotherapist,
	with 40% feeling that this should be offered outside the
                  health service.
	CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners vary in their perceptions
                  of what
	constitutes effective therapy in IBS. They are willing to
                  consider

                  usually attributed
	to different patient characteristics, variations in outcome
                  assessment,

                  the
	variation in treatment effects between drug trials might be
                  caused

	can modify the analgesic effect of tramadol relative to

	chronic pain patients. In a 2 x 2 factorial, randomized,
                  placebo-controlled,
	double-blind trial, chronic pain patients attending a chronic
                  pain
	outpatient clinic were randomized to receive a single oral
                  dose of
	50 mg tramadol or placebo, and they were further randomized to
                  receive
	positive or neutral information, verbally expressed by the
                  physician,
	regarding the expected analgesic effect of the drug: Pain
                  intensity
	was measured using a 10 centimeter visual analogue scale at
                  baseline,
	and 0.5, 1, 2, 4 6, and 8 hours after. baseline. The one-hour
                  pain
	intensity difference, calculated as the sum of pain intensity
                  differences
	between baseline and 0.5 and 1 hour was taken as main outcome
                  measure.
	The one-hour sum of pain intensity differences of 28 patients
                  treated
	after positive expectation and randomized to tramadol was 1.4
                  cm,
	while in 27 patients randomized to placebo, if was 0.8
                  cm. This corresponds
	with an analgesic effect of tramadol relative to placebo of
                  0.6 cm
	(95% confidence interval [CI], -0.5 cm to 1.8 cm). The 28
                  patients
	in the neutral expectancy group who were randomized to
                  tramadol reported
	a 1.4 cm decrease on the sum of pain intensity differences,
                  while
	28 patients in the placebo group reported a 0.9 cm
                  decrease. This
	corresponds with an analgesic effect of tramadol relative to
                  placebo
	of 0.5 cm (95% CI, -0.9 cm to 1.8 cm). The 0.1 cm difference
                  (0.6
	cm - 0.5 cm) in analgesic effect between positive and neutral
                  expectancy
	group, was not statistically significant (95% CI, -0.7 nn to
                  1.0
	cm). This trial did not discern a significant difference in
                  the analgesic
	effect of tramadol between a positive and neutral expectancy
                  group.
	This means that the phenomenon either does not exist, or we

  abstract = {Previously, we demonstrated that placebo analgesia (PA)
                  accompanies
	reductions in neural activity during painful stimulation. This
                  study
	investigated areas of the brain where the neural activity was
                  increased
	during PA. The literature has associated PA with two potential
                  mechanisms
	of action; one sustained (e.g., engaged for the duration of
                  PA),
	the other, transitory (e.g., a feedback mechanism). We propose
                  that
	PA results from the engagement of two complementary
                  pain-modulation
	mechanisms that are identified with fMRI data as a main effect
                  for
	condition or a time by condition interaction. The
                  mechanism with
	sustained activity should activate the emotional regulation
                  circuitry
	needed for memory formation of the event. The mechanism with
                  transient
	activity should process cognitive and evaluative information
                  of the
	stimuli in the context of the placebo suggestion to confirm
                  the expectations
	set by it. To identify regions involved with these mechanisms,
                  we
	re-analyzed fMRI data from two conditions: baseline (B) and
                  PA. Results
	support the presence of both mechanisms, identified as two
                  neural-networks
	with different temporal characteristics. Regions with
                  sustained activity
	primarily involved the temporal and parahippocampal
                  cortices. Conversely,
	brain regions with transient activity included linguistic
                  centers
	in the left hemisphere and frontal regions of the right
                  hemisphere
	generally associated with executive functioning. Together,
                  these
	mechanisms likely engage analgesic processes and then simply
                  monitor
	the system for unexpected stimuli, effectively liberating
                  resources
	for other processes. Identifying brain regions associated with
                  pain-modulation
	with different temporal profiles is consistent with the
                  multidimensionality
	of PA and highlights the need for continued investigation of
                  this

  abstract = {Pain requires the integration of sensory, cognitive, and
                  affective
	information. The use of placebo is a common methodological
                  ploy in
	many fields, including pain. Neuroimaging studies of pain and
                  placebo
	analgesia (PA) have yet to identify a mechanism of
                  action. Because
	PA must result from higher order processes, it is likely
                  influenced
	by cognitive and affective dimensions of the pain
                  experience. A network
	of brain regions involved in these processes includes the
                  anterior
	and posterior insula (A-Ins, P-Ins), dorsal anterior cingulate
                  cortex
	(DACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the
                  supplementary
	motor area (SMA). We used connectivity analyses to investigate
                  the
	underlying mechanisms associated with Placebo analgesia in a
                  group
	of chronic pain patients. Structural equation models (SEM) of
                  fMRI
	data evaluated the inter-regional connectivity of these
                  regions across
	three conditions: (1) initial Baseline (B1), (2) placebo (PA),
                  and
	(3) Placebo Match (PM). SEM results of B1 data in the left
                  hemisphere
	confirmed hypothesized regional relationships. However,
                  inter-regional
	relationships were dynamic and the network models varied
                  across hemispheres
	and conditions. Deviations from the B1 model in the PA and PM
                  conditions
	correspond to our manipulation of expectation for pain. The
                  dynamic
	changes in inter-regional influence across conditions are
                  interpreted
	in the context of a self-reinforcing feedback loop involved in
                  the
	induction and maintenance of PA. Although it is likely that
                  placebo
	analgesia results partly from afferent inhibition of a
                  nociceptive
	signal, the mechanisms likely involve the interaction of a
                  cognitive-affective

	METHODS: A total of 3,047 patients with LUTS were randomized
                  to either
	placebo, doxazosin (4 to 8 mg), finasteride (5 mg), or a
                  combination

                  progression
	of BPH, defined as either a confirmed 4-point or greater
                  increase

	event data from the 737 men who were randomized to
                  placebo. RESULTS:
	The rate of overall clinical progression of BPH events in the
                  placebo
	group was 4.5 per 100 person-years, for a cumulative incidence
                  (among

                  risk of
	BPH progression was significantly greater in patients on
                  placebo
	with a baseline TPV of 31 ml or greater vs less than 31 ml (p
                  <0.0001),
	a baseline PSA of 1.6 ng/dl or greater vs PSA less than 1.6
                  ng/dl

                  regulatory issues
	in the design and conduct of placebo-controlled cancer
                  clinical trials.
	METHODS: Several content experts contributed to this
                  article. RESULTS:
	Specific criteria can be applied to determine the appropriate
                  use
	of placebos in oncology drug development. Placebo controls may
                  be
	justified to prove efficacy of a new treatment in diseases
                  with high
	placebo response rates; in conditions that wax and wane in
                  severity,
	have spontaneous remissions, or have an uncertain and
                  unpredictable
	course; when existing therapies are minimally effective or
                  have serious
	adverse effects; or in the absence of effective therapy. Use
                  of placebos
	may also be justified to assure blinding of physicians and
                  patients
	regarding treatment assignment so as to minimize bias in
                  assessment
	of study end points. If a trial meets these methodologic
                  criteria,
	it must then fulfill additional criteria to be considered
                  ethical.
	These criteria include full disclosure to patients and an
                  assurance
	that participants randomly assigned to placebo are not
                  substantially
	more likely than those in active treatment group(s) to die;
                  suffer
	irreversible morbidity, disability, or other substantial
                  harms; suffer
	reversible but serious harm; or suffer severe
                  discomfort. CONCLUSION:
	We conclude that placebo-controlled oncology trials are
                  scientifically
	feasible, ethically justifiable, and may be necessary or
                  desirable
	to meet regulatory standards for drug approval. Using
                  cross-over
	or randomized withdrawal trial designs, requiring inclusion of
                  state-of-the-art
	palliative care, and developing valid and acceptable
                  surrogates for
	survival are critical strategies to address some of the
                  ethical dilemmas
	associated with placebo-controlled trials.},

                  that the
	placebo effect is a myth. The accompanying editorial by
                  J. C. Bailar
	(2001) suggests that despite the negative data many still want
                  to
	believe in the placebo effect; the placebo effect is part of
                  our
	cultural lore, our common home. This suggestion sparked a new
                  thought:
	What if where you come from, i.e., cultural beliefs instilled
                  by
	professional training, has an impact on results? To test the

                  participants
	affects their responses and can be predicted by experimenter
                  attributes,
	the Hrobjartsson and Gotzsche data was divided by the first
                  author's
	degree (PhD vs MD) and the direction of the effect size (trend
                  for

                  find
	placebo effects than MDs: 73% of PhDs found pro-placebo
                  effects and
	27% of PhDs found con-placebo effects; 57% of MDs found
                  pro-placebo
	effects, 43% found con-placebo effects. The pattern for PhDs
                  was
	consistent across medical categories (psychiatry, internal
                  medicine)
	but the pattern of MDs shifted toward that of PhDs in research
                  areas

                  by reward-related
	mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests that it is the
                  expectation of
	reward (in this case, the expectation of clinical benefit)
                  that triggers
	the placebo response. In Parkinson's disease, the placebo
                  effect
	is mediated by the release of dopamine in the striatum. The
                  authors
	argue that placeboinduced dopamine release in limbic
                  structures,
	particularly in the nucleus accumbens, could also be a major
                  biochemical
	substrate for the placebo effect encountered in other medical
                  disorders.
	Other neuroactive substances involved in the reward circuitry
                  (e.g.,
	opioids) are also likely to contribute to the placebo
                  response, and
	such contribution may be disorder specific (e.g., opioid
                  release
	in placebo analgesia; serotonin regulation in response to
                  placebo
	antidepressants). In addition, placebos may have a role in
                  substitution

	effects for clinical pain management. However, it is often

	by mainstream allopathic medicine due to a paucity of data
                  demonstrating
	its neurophysiological differentiation from

	A challenge for biomedical scientists is to prove that

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of trial
                  participants respond
	to placebos for a variety of conditions. Despite the common
                  conduct
	of these trials and the strong emphasis placed on informed
                  consent,
	very little is known about informing participants about their
                  individual
	treatment allocation at trial closure. This study aims to
                  address
	this gap in the literature by exploring treatment beliefs and
                  reactions
	to feedback about treatment allocation in the participants of
                  a placebo-controlled
	randomized clinical trial (RCT). METHODS: Survey of trial
                  participants
	using a semi-structured questionnaire including close and
                  open-ended
	questions administered as telephone interviews and postal
                  questionnaires.
	Trial participants were enrolled in a double-blind
                  placebo-controlled
	RCT evaluating the effectiveness of corticosteroid for heel
                  pain
	(ISRCTN36539116). The trial had closed and participants
                  remained
	blind to treatment allocation. We assessed treatment
                  expectations,
	the percentage of participants who wanted to be informed about
                  their
	treatment allocation, their ability to guess and reactions to
                  debriefing.
	RESULTS: Forty-six (73%) contactable participants responded to
                  our
	survey. Forty-two were eligible (four participants with
                  bilateral
	disease were excluded as they had received both
                  treatments). Most
	(79%) participants did not have any expectations prior to
                  receiving
	treatment, but many 'hoped' that something would help. Reasons
                  for
	not having high expectations included the experimental nature
                  of
	their care and possibility that they may get a
                  placebo. Participants
	were hopeful because their pain was so severe and because they
                  trusted
	the staff and services. Most (83%) wanted to be informed about
                  their
	treatment allocation and study results. Over half (55%) said
                  they
	could not guess which treatment they had been randomized to,
                  and
	many of those who attempted a guess were incorrect. Reactions
                  to
	treatment debriefing were generally positive, including in
                  placebo
	responders. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that most trial
                  participants
	want to be informed about their treatment allocation and trial
                  results.
	Further research is required to develop measure of hope and
                  expectancy
	and to rigorously evaluate the effects of debriefing

	50% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD), pain syndromes,
                  and
	depression. The response is more pronounced with invasive
                  procedures
	or advanced disease. Physiologic and biochemical changes have
                  been
	studied in an effort to understand the mechanisms underlying
                  placebo-related
	clinical improvement. In PD, objective clinical improvements
                  in parkinsonism
	correlate with dopaminergic activation of the striatum,

                  38.0-46.5\%). Significant
	heterogeneity existed across trials (range
                  15.0-72.2\%, P <
	0.00001). Higher placebo response rates correlated with a
                  longer
	duration of treatment ( r = 0.455, P = 0.05) and a greater
                  number
	of office visits ( r = 0.633, P = 0.03). Among IBS patients in
                  CAM
	trials, the placebo response rate is high. That this rate is
                  similar
	in magnitude to that seen in conventional medicine trials
                  suggests
	that the placebo response is independent of the type of
                  therapy used
	and that it is not particularly
                  Ã¢â‚¬ËœenhancedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢

                  surgery for

	is renewed interest in the ethics of using

	placebos in surgical trials, where otherwise there are no

	but where patients may guess to which arm they have been
                  allocated.
	This paper seeks to clarify the ethical arguments surrounding
                  the
	use of active placebos in trials, and to set up a notation for
                  assessing
	the ethics of trials more generally. We first establish an
                  framework
	by which ethics committees can analyze such trials. We examine
                  (1)
	the scientific value of the research; (2) the expected risks
                  and
	benefits to individual patients, and (3) the voluntary nature
                  of
	consent. We then contrast the implications of this framework
                  for
	inert and active placebo-controlled trials, respectively. In
                  particular,
	we analyze their relative expected utility using three main
                  utility
	factors, namely, treatment effects, placebo effects, and
                  altruism.
	We conclude that, when the intervention is already widely
                  available,
	active placebo trials rely more heavily on altruism than do
                  inert
	placebo trials and, when the intervention is restricted, this
                  excess
	reliance may not be needed. What our analysis provides is the
                  explicit
	justification for the apparent caution of Institutional Review
                  Boards
	or ethics committees when reviewing sham operations,
                  especially when
	the expected harm is not trivial and the risk of exploitation

	high. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of World Journal of

	Questions regarding the validity of the design center about

	instructions, particularly in the antiplacebo cell at higher
                  blood
	alcohol content (BAC) levels. This study tested the
                  plausibility
	of two misattribution strategies designed to reduce the
                  conflict
	between experimenter instructions and internal cues of
                  drunkenness.
	Forty-two participants (BAC = .055) were told that they
                  received
	no alcohol, with internal cues of drunkenness said to be
                  produced
	by a (sham) second drug, a (placebo) tachistoscopic display,
                  or no

	intoxication without reporting less physical impairment than

	more frequently in the control group than in the placebo drug
                  group.
	Mean time to first reported doubt of experimenter instructions
                  was
	longer for the placebo drug group. A manipulation check
                  designed
	to account for demand effects indicated that instituting the
                  pharmacologic
	misattribution increased the success of the manipulation over
                  the
	control group. Providing a credible attribution for internal
                  symptoms
	of drunkenness makes experimenter's instructions more
                  credible, improving

                  through intensive
	research activity during recent years. It seems important to
                  make
	a clear distinction between the placebo effect in clinical
                  trials
	and the placebo effect in clinical practice. In the first
                  scenario,
	our effects are directed towards minimising its influence on
                  the
	results whereas, in the second scenario, we might consider
                  maximising
	it for the benefit of the patient. It also seems important to

	between the

  abstract = {Even though widely used in today's clinical practice,
                  acupuncture
	has remained a controversial subject. Many reviews are
                  currently
	available but most lack a critical stance and some are overtly
                  promotional.
	The aim of this overview is to provide a balanced, critical
                  analysis
	of the existing evidence. Some of the original concepts of
                  traditional
	acupuncture are not supported by good scientific
                  evidence. Several
	plausible theories attempt to explain how acupuncture works
                  but none
	are proved beyond doubt. The clinical effectiveness of
                  acupuncture
	continues to attract controversy. Many controlled clinical
                  trials
	and numerous systematic reviews of these studies have been
                  published.
	Considerable problems are encountered when interpreting these
                  data.
	Heterogeneity is a significant drawback of both clinical
                  trials and
	systematic reviews. Some of the controversies may be resolved
                  through
	the use of the new placebo
                  needles which enable
                  researchers
	to adequately control for placebo effects of acupuncture. The
                  majority
	of studies using such devices fails to show effects beyond a
                  placebo
	response. Acupuncture has been associated with serious adverse
                  events
	but most large-scale studies suggest that these are probably
                  rare.
	Nonserious adverse effects occur in
                  7-11\% of all
                  patients.
	In conclusion, acupuncture remains steeped in
                  controversy. Some findings
	are encouraging but others suggest that its clinical effects
                  mainly
	depend on a placebo response. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright

                  Any
	type of clinical study of any type of distant healing
                  published between
	2000 and December 2002. DATA EXTRACTION: For each included
                  study,
	essential data were extracted and summarised in narrative
                  form. RESULTS:
	8 non-randomised and 9 randomised clinical trials were
                  located. The
	majority of the rigorous trials do not to support the
                  hypothesis
	that distant healing has specific therapeutic effects. The
                  results
	of two studies furthermore suggest that distant healing can be

	with adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Since the publication of our
                  previous
	systematic review in 2000, several rigorous new studies have
                  emerged.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complementary (or alternative) medicine has
                  become a prevalent
	phenomenon in most industrialized countries. At present the
                  evidence
	from randomized controlled trials investigating its
                  effectiveness
	is fragmentary and therefore inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To
                  assess whether
	physicians perceive complementary medicine as useful and/or
                  effective.
	METHOD: A literature search was performed to retrieve all
                  relevant
	articles. Twelve surveys addressing this question were found
                  and
	analyzed by evaluating perceived usefulness and/or
                  effectiveness.
	RESULTS: The results show a remarkable variability between
                  surveys.
	On average physicians perceive complementary medicine as
                  moderately
	effective--the rating was 46 +/- 18 on a scale of 0 to 100
                  points.
	Young physicians seem to judge complementary medicine more
                  optimistically
	than their more seasoned colleagues. There is no trend to
                  suggest
	that complementary medicine is increasingly perceived as
                  useful and/or
	effective. The data do not answer the question whether
                  physicians
	view complementary medicine as a nonspecific powerful placebo
                  or
	as specifically effective. CONCLUSION: Complementary medicine
                  may
	be useful; however, the notion urgently needs to be tested in
                  randomized
	controlled trials.},

  abstract = {Modern science begins to understand pleasure as a
                  potential component
	of salutogenesis. Thereby, pleasure is described as a state or
                  feeling
	of happiness and satisfaction resulting from an experience
                  that one
	enjoys. We examine the neurobiological factors underlying
                  reward
	processes and pleasure phenomena. Further, health implications
                  related
	to pleasurable activities are analyzed. With regard to
                  possible negative
	effects of pleasure, we focus on addiction and motivational
                  toxicity.
	Pleasure can serve cognition, productivity and health, but
                  simultaneously
	promotes addiction and other negative behaviors, i.e.,
                  motivational
	toxicity. It is a complex neurobiological phenomenon, relying
                  on
	reward circuitry or limbic activity. These processes involve
                  dopaminergic
	signaling. Moreover, endorphin and endogenous morphinergic
                  mechanisms
	may play a role. Natural rewarding activities are necessary
                  for survival
	and appetitive motivation, usually governing beneficial
                  biological
	behaviors like eating, sex and reproduction. Social contacts
                  can
	further facilitate the positive effects exerted by pleasurable
                  experiences.
	However, artificial stimulants can be detrimental, since
                  flexibility
	and normal control of behavior are deteriorated. Additionally,
                  addictive
	drugs are capable of directly acting on reward pathways. Thus,
                  the
	concrete outcome of pleasant experiences may be a question of
                  dose.
	Moderate pleasurable experiences are able to enhance
                  biological flexibility
	and health. Hence, pleasure can be a resistance resource or
                  may serve
	salutogenesis. Natural rewards are mediated by sensory organ
                  stimulation,
	thereby exhibiting a potential association with complementary
                  medical
	approaches. Trust and belief can be part of a self-healing
                  potential
	connected with rewarding stimuli. Further, the placebo
                  response physiologically
	resembles pleasure phenomena, since both involve brain's
                  reward circuitry
	stimulation and subjective feelings of well-being. Pleasurable
                  activities
	can stimulate personal growth and may help to induce healthy
                  behavioral
	changes, including stress management. However, more research
                  is needed
	to better understand the nature, neurobiology and maybe
                  dangerous
	aspects of pleasure. Also, a possible involvement of
                  endogenous morphinergic
	signaling has to be studied further.},

  abstract = {A common practice in depression trials is to exclude
                  patients whose
	depressive symptoms improve between Screen and Baseline
                  evaluations
	under the assumption that they are more likely to respond to
                  placebo.
	The present study investigated this contention by examining
                  the relationship
	between pre-randomization changes in Hamilton depression
                  rating scale
	(HAMD) scores to post-randomization placebo response and
                  drug-placebo
	separation. Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
                  trials
	(active medication=fluoxetine or paroxetine) were conducted in
                  outpatients
	with Major Depressive Disorder using a novel design in which a
                  depressive
	severity inclusion criterion (HAMD >/= 22) was utilized only
                  at Screen.
	Patients with no change or minimal (1 point) improvement on
                  the HAMD
	between Screen and Baseline had the lowest placebo response
                  and the
	best drug-placebo separation. Patients with pre-randomization
                  improvement
	of 2 points or greater had moderately higher placebo response
                  and
	poorer drug-placebo separation. Patients who worsened between
                  Screen
	and Baseline showed the highest placebo response and the
                  poorest
	drug-placebo separation. There were no obvious differences in
                  demographic
	variables between the groups which could account for the
                  findings.
	In our original analyses 3/4 studies failed to show
                  significant drug-placebo
	separation. When only patients with no change or
                  pre-randomization
	improvement of 1 point were used in the analyses, 3/4 studies
                  showed
	significant drug-placebo separation while the other study
                  approached
	significance, p < 0.07. These results suggest that
                  pre-randomization
	changes in HAMD scores may predict post-randomization placebo
                  response
	and drug-placebo separation. Further, pre-randomization
                  increases
	in HAMD scores (i.e., worsening) may be the best predictor of
                  heightened
	placebo responding and poor drug placebo separation.},

                  pharmacological
	adverse events or might there be another explanation? A
                  35-year-old
	woman reported a long-standing history of chronic daily
                  migraine.
	She previously had been treated by numerous neurologists and
                  had
	tried a number of medications; all caused nonspecific side
                  effects
	and resulted in her stopping therapy. She also had a history
                  of anxiety
	and depression. Is it possible that what she reported as side
                  effects
	were not actually pharmacological effects of the medications?
                  The
	expert comments to this question. The short answer is yes. The
                  brief
	clinical history provided raises the strong possibility that
                  her
	nonspecific side effects represented what some have termed the
                  nocebo
	effect, essentially the reverse of the placebo effect. The
                  side effects
	that occur are not commonly associated with the given
                  medication.
	Even if they are, they may be disproportionately
                  severe. Patients
	who are anxious, depressed, or who amplify bodily sensations
                  are
	more likely to be at risk. Sometimes a 2-step strategy for
                  prescribing
	is best. The first step is to use a very low and
                  subtherapeutic dose
	of the chosen medication to see if the patient can tolerate it
                  and
	then to slowly titrate the dose up to the therapeutic
                  range. Finally,
	if side effects do occur, remember that a realistic goal is to
                  help
	the patient tolerate side effects rather than eliminate them
                  entirely.

                  response patterns
	to antidepressants: "true drug" response (TDR) and "placebo
                  pattern"
	response (PPR). This study examines the relationship between
                  cognitive
	factors and TDR and PPR to fluoxetine. METHODS: We assessed
                  310 outpatients
	meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD)
                  who
	were enrolled in an 8-week open trial of fluoxetine 20
                  mg/day. Response
	patterns were determined using the clinical global
                  impressions-improvement
	(CGI-I). We administered the following self-rated scales to
                  all patients
	at the baseline visit and at endpoint: perceived stress scale
                  (PSS),
	cognitions questionnaire (CQ), Beck hopelessness scale (BHS)
                  and
	dysfunctional attitudes scale (DAS). RESULTS: One hundred and
                  thirty-four
	patients had TDR, 66 patients had PPR, and 110 patients were
                  non-responders
	(NR). Demographic variables and severity of depression at
                  baseline
	(HAMD-17) were not significantly different between the two
                  response
	pattern groups. We compared cognitive factors before and after
                  treatment
	across patients with TDR and PPR, and there were no
                  significant differences
	at baseline in CQ, PSS, BHS, and DAS scores. At endpoint,
                  outpatients
	with PPR had significantly lower scores on the PSS (p < 0.001)
                  compared
	to the patients with TDR, even after adjusting for multiple
                  comparisons
	and severity of depression at endpoint. CONCLUSIONS:
                  Significant
	differences in cognitive/psychological factors, specifically
                  lower
	post-treatment perceived stress, accompany "placebo" pattern
                  of response
	to antidepressant treatment and differentiate it from "true
                  drug"
	response pattern, as defined by pattern analysis. Copyright

	response to a preliminary treatment cycle with placebo were
                  admitted
	to a double-blind study on placebo versus antiprostaglandin
                  agents
	(naproxen and pirprofen). To evaluate the placebo effect and
                  its
	duration, the treatment was given for 4 successive
                  cycles. Whereas
	the antiprostaglandin agents were effective in most of the
                  patients
	(in 80% of the pirprofen group and 85.7% of the naproxen
                  group) and
	this efficacy was maintained throughout the study, a favorable
                  response
	to placebo was observed in 84% in the first cycle, 29% in the
                  second,
	16% in the third and 10% in the fourth. The incidence of side
                  effects
	was similar in the placebo and the active treatment groups
                  (35.4%
	vs. 37.5%). It is postulated that a placebo effect in
                  dysmenorrhea
	is due to a central analgesic mechanism mediated by endorphin
                  release
	or possibly to psychological dynamics (mental or conditioning
                  theories).
	However, this effect loses efficacy with time possibly due to
                  a decreased
	susceptibility to the opioid action of the central nervous
                  circuits
	responsible for menstrual pain perception or to deconditioning

                  which

	of these differences illuminates the nature of medical regimes
                  embedded
	in dissimilar systems of knowledge and reveals the strengths
                  and
	weaknesses of each. The analysis demonstrates the
                  dramaturgical nature
	of the biomedicine-patient encounter with its inherent
                  underlying
	contradictions, in contrast to the sacred healer-patient
                  interactions
	where the drama is lacking. The comparison reveals the
                  importance
	of treatment techniques in sacred healing in contrast to the
                  doctor's
	persona in biomedical treatment. The article concludes with a
                  consideration
	of contemporary sociocultural forces that have led to the
                  emphasis
	on the physicians's persona in biomedical practice.},

  abstract = {Objectives. Attitudes towards medical care have a strong
                  effect on
	utilization and outcomes. However, there has been little
                  attention
	to the impact on outcomes of doubts about the value of medical
                  care.
	This study examines the impact of skepticism toward medical
                  care
	on mortality using data from the 1987 National Medical
                  Expenditure
	Survey (NMES). Methods. A nationally representative sample
                  from the
	United States comprising 18,240 persons
                  (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 25 years) were
                  surveyed.
	Skepticism was measured through an 8-item scale. Mortality at
                  5-year
	follow-up was ascertained through the National Death
                  Index. Results.
	In a proportional hazards survival analysis of 5-year
                  mortality that
	controlled for age, sex, race, education, income, marital
                  status,
	morbidity, and health status, skepticism toward medical care
                  independently
	predicted subsequent mortality. That risk was attenuated after
                  adjustment
	for health behaviors but not after adjustment for health
                  insurance
	status. Conclusion. Medical skepticism may be a risk factor
                  for early
	death. That effect may be mediated through higher rates of
                  unhealthy
	behavior among the medically skeptical. Further studies using
                  more
	reliable measures are needed.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: A neutral stimulus repeatedly paired with
                  administration
	of a drug may elicit a conditioned response. This process,
                  termed
	pharmacological classical conditioning, may be important in
                  the understanding
	of placebo effects. OBJECTIVE: The unconditioned response to
                  caffeine
	is increased physiological and psychological arousal. The
                  present
	study investigated whether stimuli associated with the use of
                  caffeine,
	i.e. the smell and taste of coffee, elicited a conditioned
                  increase
	in arousal. It was also investigated whether conditioned
                  arousal
	modulated the unconditioned arousal induced by
                  caffeine. METHODS:
	Twenty subjects who drank at least two cups of coffee per day
                  were
	exposed to four conditions in a within-subjects design, where
                  the
	subjects received coffee or orange juice crossed with placebo
                  or
	2 mg/kg caffeine. Dependent variables were skin conductance
                  responses
	and startle reflexes to 85 dB noise bursts, skin conductance
                  levels,
	blood pressure, heart rate, and subjective measures of
                  arousal. RESULTS:
	Both caffeine (caffeinated juice) and caffeine-associated
                  stimuli
	(decaffeinated coffee) increased subjective and physiological
                  arousal.
	When caffeine and caffeine-associated stimuli were presented
                  together
	(caffeinated coffee), a non-significant tendency towards an
                  additive
	effect of the conditioned arousal on the unconditioned arousal
                  to
	caffeine was seen in some dependent variables. CONCLUSIONS:
                  Presentation
	of caffeine-associated stimuli to caffeine-users elicited
                  conditioned
	responses similar to the unconditioned drug response. Thus,
                  presentation
	of caffeine-associated stimuli could be used as an

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Administration of the muscle relaxant
                  carisoprodol and
	placebo was crossed with information that was agonistic or
                  antagonistic
	to the effect of carisoprodol. It was investigated whether
                  information
	alone induced physiological and psychological responses, and
                  whether
	information modified the response to the drug. METHODS: Half
                  of the
	subjects received capsules containing 525 mg carisoprodol
                  together
	with information that the drug acted in a specific way (Groups
                  Relaxant/C,
	Stimulant/C, and No Information/C). The other half of the
                  subjects
	received lactose (Groups Relaxant/L, Stimulant/L, and No
                  Information/L).
	Dependent variables were blink reflexes and skin conductance
                  responses,
	subjective measures of tension and sleepiness, and serum
                  carisoprodol
	and meprobamate concentrations. Recordings were made between
                  15 and
	130 minutes after administration of the capsules. RESULTS: The
                  Stimulant/L
	group reported more tension compared with the other two
                  groups, and
	carisoprodol increased tension even more in the Stimulant/C
                  group.
	The Relaxant/C group displayed higher levels of carisoprodol
                  serum
	concentration compared with the other groups that received
                  carisoprodol.
	CONCLUSIONS: Reported tension was modulated in the direction
                  suggested
	by the stimulant information. The effect of carisoprodol on
                  tension
	was also modulated by stimulant information. Increased
                  carisoprodol
	absorption in the group that received relaxant information
                  could
	be a mechanism in the placebo response.},

                  increased

	increased subjective arousal after both one and two cups of

	not generate placebo responses after administration of
                  decaffeinated
	coffee. Expectations were dose dependent, whereas the placebo
                  response
	was not. However, expected alertness after coffee predicted

	In general, extrapyramidal motor side effects are documented
                  in more
	detail than others. Various reasons may account for
                  placebo-related
	EPS: firstly, this could be a true placebo effect: experienced
                  patients
	who are familiar with EPS from previous treatments will have a
                  certain
	expectation bias towards developing these in the circumstances
                  of
	a clinical trial. Secondly, placebo-related EPS could be due
                  to the
	treatment immediately preceeding the clinical trial. Short
                  wash out
	periods could lead to a carry over of EPS from previous
                  treatment.
	On the other hand stopping antipsychotics could unmask covert
                  tardive
	dyskinesia. Thirdly, misdiagnosis cannot always be ruled
                  out. It
	is important to consider the complexity of placebo-related
                  side effects
	since claims about safety and tolerability of investigational
                  drugs
	are often based on placebo-new drug differences concerning
                  side effect
	incidence rates. This difference may be misleading, if the

                  changes associated
	with placebo in clinical trials suggested a beneficial effect
                  of
	placebo treatments, pointing to a dissociation between
                  subjective
	and objective measures of sleep, the current experiment was
                  directly
	aimed to assess the effects of an inert compound, administered
                  with
	the suggestion that it was a hypnotic substance in subjects
                  with
	mild sleep complaints. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was
                  to compare
	subjective, behavioral, polysomnographic (PSG), and
                  quantitative
	electroencephalographic (EEG) changes during a night preceded
                  or
	not by the intake of two 50-mg lactose capsules. METHODS: Ten
                  female
	students, selected by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index,
                  slept for
	three consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory, with the
                  experimental
	(EXP) night defined by the administration of two 50-mg lactose
                  pills.
	Self-ratings of sleep quality and performance were assessed
                  upon
	morning awakening of baseline (BSL) and EXP nights. RESULTS:
                  The
	EXP nights were self-rated as more restful and characterized
                  by a
	decreased number of nocturnal awakenings than the BSL
                  nights. PSG
	measures showed that wakefulness after sleep onset
                  significantly
	decreased during the EXP night as compared to the BSL
                  night. The
	EXP nights also showed an increase of 0.5-4.0 Hz power during
                  nonrapid
	eye movement sleep and a decrease of EEG activity in the beta
                  frequency
	range during rapid eye movement sleep only at central brain
                  sites.
	A specific improvement of behavioral measures was also found
                  upon
	morning awakening after the EXP night compared to the BSL
                  night.
	CONCLUSIONS: The administration of an inert pill improves both
                  the
	subjective and objective quality of sleep. The reduced sleep
                  fragmentation
	and the effects on some quantitative EEG markers of sleep
                  homeostasis
	suggest that the experimental manipulation induced coherent
                  changes
	in the subsequent sleep, resembling an enhancement of sleep
                  pressure.
	The regional differences of EEG activity suggest the
                  involvement
	of a specific physiological mechanism distinct from that of
                  effective
	treatments.},

  abstract = {Background: A recent well-conducted meta-analysis showed
                  that placebo
	effect is associated with a possible small benefit for
                  subjective
	outcomes, but has no significant effects on objective
                  outcomes. Objective:
	Herein, we aimed to investigate the immediate effects of two
                  different
	types of placebo [placebo pill and sham transcranial magnetic
                  stimulation
	(TMS)] in Parkinsons disease
                  (PD) patients and compared them
	to the standard treatment (levodopa) in a proper randomized,
                  double-blind,
	crossover clinical trial. Methods: PD patients received three
                  different
	interventions on different days: levodopa, placebo pill, and
                  sham
	TMS. The motor function was assessed using simple and choice
                  reaction
	time, Unified Parkinsons
                  Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), finger
	tapping, Purdue Pegboard test, time to button up, walking time
                  and
	supination-pronation. The subjective motor function was
                  measured
	by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: The results showed
                  that
	there was a significant motor function in the motor function
                  only
	after the treatment with levodopa, but not after treatment
                  with placebo
	pills or sham TMS. However, patients reported a similar
                  subjective
	improvement in motor function indexed by VAS following these
                  three
	treatments. Conclusion: These results suggest that placebo
                  interventions
	in PD may have an immediate subjective sensation of
                  improvement but
	result in no significant objective motor changes compared with
                  levodopa
	treatment. Although physiological changes are possible after a
                  placebo
	intervention, our findings suggest that the acute placebo
                  effect
	in PD may be the result of the subjective change in the motor
                  rating
	only. Copyright 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel

	two sets of reasons: the provider must assess the special

                  medical

	there is a general consensus that hypnotizability can be
                  reliably

                  about
	a theoretical definition of placebo (including placebo effect,

	response and nocebo). There is no widely accepted measure of

	Parkinson's disease. It has been shown that placebo responses

                  disease,

	amounts of endogenous dopamine in both the dorsal and ventral

  abstract = {Objective. To determine the magnitude of the placebo
                  effect in deep-brain
	stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD).Background. The
                  placebo
	effect in PD is related to the expectation of clinical
                  benefit. Changes
	in expectation occurring in DBS crossover studies can be used
                  to
	estimate the associated placebo effect. For example, the
                  response
	to active-DBS is predicted to be greater in patients who have
                  previously
	experienced the effect of placebo-DBS than in those without
                  such
	an experience.Methods. Data were obtained by searches of
                  Medline
	and PubMed using three keywords: Parkinson's disease,
                  deep-brain
	stimulation, and crossover study. Between-group comparisons of
                  the
	effect of active-DBS were performed by <f>t</f>-test and
                  analysis
	of covariance.Results. Data on 126 PD patients were available
                  for
	analysis. These patients participated in a multicenter,
                  two-period,
	placebo-controlled crossover study on the efficacy of DBS for
                  PD.
	As predicted, active-DBS was found to be more effective when
                  preceded
	by placebo-DBS (i.e. in the high expectation group) than when
                  not
	(i.e. in the lower expectation group). The estimated magnitude
                  of
	the placebo effect in DBS was equivalent to 39% of the
                  magnitude
	of the effect of active-DBS.Conclusions. There is a prominent
                  placebo
	effect associated with DBS in PD. Crossover studies may be
                  useful
	for estimating the placebo effect in other medical
                  conditions. [Copyright

                  comparative trials,

	Whether psychotherapy plus pill placebo is the same as
                  psychotherapy
	alone is an empirical question which however has to date never
                  been
	examined systematically. Methods: We conducted a systematic
                  review
	and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that
                  directly
	compared cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) alone against CBT
                  plus
	pill placebo in the treatment of panic disorder. Results:
                  Extensive
	literature search was able to identify three relevant RCTs. At
                  the
	end of the acute phase treatment, patients who received CBT
                  plus
	placebo had 26% (95%CI: 2 to 55%) increased chances of
                  responding

                  was
	no longer statistically significant (22%, 95%CI: -10% to
                  64%). Conclusion:
	The act of taking a pill placebo may enhance the placebo
                  effect already
	contained in the effective psychotherapeutic intervention
                  during

	and addiction in different cultural and clinical settings is
                  explicated
	regarding both beneficial and compromising

	to 76%. The aims of this study were to quantify the pooled
                  placebo
	response rate and identify the factors affecting it. Methods
                  We performed
	a meta-analysis of 110 RCTs carried out between 1955 and 2005
                  and
	published in English. Regression analysis was used to identify
                  factors
	significantly modifying placebo response. Results The pooled
                  placebo
	remission rate was 23\% (95%CI: 18.4â€“28%) and the
                  pooled placebo
	improvement rate was 32.1\% (95\%CI:
                  28.1â€“36.3\%). Multivariate analysis
	showed that the country where the study was performed
                  (P=0.025
	for placebo remission and P=0.0083 for placebo
                  response
	rates) significantly influenced the placebo remission and
                  response
	rates. Conclusion Placebo remission and response rates in RCTs
                  of
	UC are highly variable and are significantly influenced by the
                  country
	in which the RCT is performed.},

  abstract = {The ready availability and extreme popularity of Western
                  pharmaceuticals
	in developing countries poses important general issues for
                  medical
	anthropology. In attempting to explain why medicines are so
                  attractive
	in so many different cultures, this article suggests that they
                  facilitate
	particular social and symbolic processes. The key to their
                  charm
	is their concreteness; in them healing is objectified. As
                  things,
	they allow therapy to be disengaged from its social
                  entanglements.
	Medicines are commodities which pass from one context of
                  meaning
	to another. As substances, they are "good to think with" in
                  both
	metaphoric and metonymic senses. They enhance the perception
                  of illness
	as something tangible, and they facilitate communication about
                  experiences
	that may be difficult to express. In the course of their
                  transaction,
	they bear with them associations to authoritative
                  professionals and
	the potency and potential of other cultural contexts of which

                  the effects
	of focus of attention and expected drug effects in reactions
                  to a
	placebo. In Exp I (36 Ss), self-aware and non-self-aware Ss
                  were
	given a placebo that was said to be either
                  performance-facilitating
	or inhibiting and then they worked on a set of arithmetic
                  problems.
	It was expected that the non-self-aware Ss, but not the
                  self-aware
	Ss, would display a self-serving bias in their attributions
                  regarding
	the effects of the placebo. Specifically, it was predicted
                  that non-self-aware
	Ss would attribute more arousal to the performance-inhibiting
                  drug
	than the performance-facilitating drug, since such
                  attributions would
	make actual performance on the task look more impressive and
                  be psychologically
	beneficial. Consistent with these predictions, there was
                  evidence
	of a self-serving bias in drug reactions only among the
                  non-self-focused
	Ss. Those who were made self-aware appeared to respond in line
                  with
	their actual (aroused) internal states by attributing some
                  arousal
	to both drugs. In Exp II (58 Ss), arousal was reduced by
                  eliminating
	the task. Self-focused Ss again appeared to be more aware of
                  their
	actual internal states because they reported less reaction to
                  the
	placebo, regardless of the effects ascribed to it. It is
                  concluded
	that perceived drug utility does affect placebo responsiveness
                  and
	that self-focused attention increases awareness of internal

	is common and associated with an increased risk of death. The
                  Sertraline
	Antidepressant Heart Attack Trial (SADHART) tested the safety
                  and
	efficacy of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in this
                  population.
	No evidence of harm was seen, and sertraline hydrochloride had
                  an
	overall beneficial effect on mood that occurred primarily in
                  patients
	with a history of episodes of major depressive disorder
                  (MDD). OBJECTIVES:
	To determine how frequently the MDD began before ACS and
                  whether
	onset of the current MDD episode before or after the ACS event
                  influenced
	response to sertraline. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: A
                  randomized,
	double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment of 369 patients
                  with ACS
	and MDD was conducted in 40 outpatient clinics in 10 countries
                  between
	April 1, 1997, and April 30, 2001. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
                  Diagnosis
	of MDD, number of previous episodes of depression, and episode
                  onset
	before or after hospitalization were established using the
                  Diagnostic
	Interview Schedule. Treatment response was measured with the
                  Clinical
	Global Impression-Improvement scale. RESULTS: Fifty-three
                  percent
	of MDD episodes began before hospitalization for the index
                  episode
	of ACS (for 197 of 369 patients), and 94% of the MDD episodes
                  began
	more than 30 days before the index ACS episode. Episodes of
                  MDD that
	began prior to ACS responded more frequently to sertraline
                  than to
	placebo (63% vs 46%, respectively; odds ratio, 2.0; 95%
                  confidence
	interval, 1.13-3.55) whereas depression with onset beginning
                  after
	hospitalization showed a high placebo response rate (69% vs
                  60%,
	respectively) and low sertraline-placebo response ratio
                  (1.15). Multivariate
	analysis indicated that time of onset of the current episode,
                  history
	of MDD, and baseline severity independently predicted the
                  sertraline-placebo
	response ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Half of the episodes of major
                  depression
	associated with ACS began long before ACS and therefore were
                  not
	caused by ACS. Patients whose current episodes of MDD begin
                  before
	ACS, those with a history of MDD, and those whose episodes are
                  severe
	should be treated because they will benefit considerably from
                  sertraline.
	Since these 3 predictors of sertraline response are
                  independent,
	having more than 1 of them substantially increases the benefit
                  of
	sertraline while reducing the chance of spontaneous
                  recovery.},

	measures: temp., bp, pulse, and performance on Sternberg and

	but relies on the randomization assumption and a parametric
                  form
	for causal effects. It can be seen as a regression model for
                  unpaired
	data, where pre- and post-randomization covariables are
                  treated differently.

                  achieved
	diastolic blood pressure reduction. We propose an exploration
                  of
	structural model checks. In the example, this reveals an
                  interaction
	between the causal effect of active dose taken and the
                  base-line

  abstract = {Changes in pain produced by psychological factors (e.g.,
                  placebo analgesia)
	are thought to result from the activity of specific cortical
                  regions.
	However, subcortical nuclei, including the periaqueductal gray
                  and
	the rostroventral medulla, also show selective activation when
                  subjects
	expect pain relief. These brainstem regions send inhibitory
                  projections
	to the spine and produce diffuse analgesic
                  responses. Regrettably
	the precise contribution of spinal mechanisms in predicting
                  the strength
	of placebo analgesia is unknown. Here, we show that
                  expectations
	regarding pain radically change the strength of spinal
                  nociceptive
	responses in humans. We found that contrary to expectations of
                  analgesia,
	expectations of hyperalgesia completely blocked the analgesic
                  effects
	of descending inhibition on spinal nociceptive
                  reflexes. Somatosensory-evoked
	brain potentials and pain ratings further confirmed changes in
                  spino-thalamo-cortical
	responses consistent with expectations and with changes in the
                  spinal
	response. These findings provide direct evidence that the
                  modulation
	of pain by expectations is mediated by endogenous pain
                  modulatory
	systems affecting nociceptive signal processing at the
                  earliest stage
	of the central nervous system. Expectation effects, therefore,
                  depend
	as much about what takes place in the spine as they do about
                  what
	takes place in the brain. Furthermore, complete suppression of
                  the
	analgesic response normally produced by descending inhibition
                  suggests
	that anti-analgesic expectations can block the efficacy of
                  pharmacologically
	valid treatments which has important implications for clinical
                  practice.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review and examine the clinical and
                  research literature
	on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with a view to establishing
                  the
	role that psychiatric factors play in the pathogenesis and
                  treatment
	of this syndrome. RESULTS: Comorbid psychiatric illness is
                  common
	with IBS, yet only a small proportion of these patients seek
                  medical
	attention. Many patients are either satisfied by reassurance
                  or experience
	symptom relief from medical treatment directed at target
                  symptoms.
	A small group of patients do not experience much relief, and
                  it is
	largely this group who come to the psychiatrist's
                  attention. Psychotropic
	medication is helpful when clinically indicated, and tricyclic
                  antidepressants
	in small doses (for example, 50 mg) may be helpful for those
                  patients
	with a pain-predominant pattern of IBS. Psychotherapy
                  (including
	cognitive, behavioural, relaxation, thermal-biofeedback,
                  insight-oriented
	therapy, and hypnosis) has been shown to provide relief,
                  although
	it has often been difficult to differentiate this improvement
                  from
	a placebo response. CONCLUSIONS: The group of patients with
                  "refractory
	IBS" used a large amount of health care resources in an
                  attempt to
	find relief to their distress. Further study is needed to gain
                  a
	better understanding of which component of psychotherapy is
                  most
	cost-effective and which patients are most likely to
                  benefit. The
	large group of those who admit to symptoms compatible with IBS
                  but
	who do not seek medical attention has to a large extent been
                  excluded
	from most studies. Exploring this group may provide further
                  insight

                  depressive disorder
	an appreciable percentage (40%) of patients in antidepressant
                  trials
	will have a placebo response. * In these trials, early changes
                  (i.e.
	within the first 4 weeks) of the clinical score scale
                  (e.g. HAMD-17)
	are associated with response at end-point. * Unpredictable
                  placebo
	response is one of the major reasons for clinical trial
                  failure in
	the evaluation of antidepressant drugs. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS:
                  * Provides
	a model to describe the time course of individual and
                  population
	placebo response. * Provides a methodology to forecast the
                  individual
	probability to be placebo responder based on early HAMD-17
                  measurements
	with an assessment of the prognostic power. * Provides a
                  methodological
	framework to implement a population enrichment strategy in the
                  design
	of clinical trials for the assessment of novel antidepressant
                  drugs.
	AIMS: To develop a probabilistic and longitudinal model
                  describing
	the time course of Hamilton's Rating Scale for Depression
                  (HAMD-17)
	total score in patients with major depressive disorders
                  treated with
	placebo and to develop predictive models to estimate the
                  response
	at end-point given HAMD-17 measurements at weeks 2 and
                  4. METHODS:
	Patients (n = 691) from seven clinical trials were analysed in
                  WinBUGS
	using a Bayesian approach. The whole dataset was randomly
                  split in
	a learning (359 patients for model definition) and a test
                  dataset
	(332 patients for assessment of model predictive
                  performance). The
	analysis of the learning dataset assumed uninformative priors,
                  whereas
	the analysis of the test dataset used the posterior parameter
                  estimates
	of the learning dataset as priors. ROC curve analysis
                  estimated the
	optimal sensitivity/specificity cut-off between false-negative
                  and
	false-positive rates and determined the prognostic allocation
                  rule
	for patients to responder and nonresponder groups. RESULTS: A
                  Weibull/linear
	model accurately described the population and individual
                  HAMD-17
	time course. The total area under the ROC curve, ranging from
                  0.76
	(logistic model with data at week 2) to 0.86 (longitudinal
                  model
	with data at week 4), provided a measure of the prognostic
                  discriminatory
	power of early HAMD-17 measures using the two models. The best
                  placebo-responder
	classification score (86.32% true and 13.68% false positive)
                  was
	associated with the longitudinal model with HAMD-17 measures
                  at week
	4. CONCLUSION: Results showed the relevance of the Bayesian
                  approach
	to predict HAMD-17 score at study end and to classify a
                  patient as
	a placebo responder given the uncertainty in parameters
                  derived from
	historical data and early HAMD-17 measurements.},

  abstract = {Abstract Rationale&nbsp;&nbsp;The cholecystokinin (CCK)
                  and opioid
	neuromodulatory systems work in an antagonistic fashion and
                  can modulate
	emotional states and noxious input in opposite directions. In
                  this
	behavioral study, we generalize this idea and suggest that CCK
                  and
	opioids can modulate the processing of other external signals,
                  e.g.,
	visual stimuli rather than only noxious
                  input. Objectives&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	objective of this study was to determine whether CCK and an
                  opioid
	agonist could modulate the emotional experience of visual
                  stimuli.
	Materials and methods&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen healthy male
                  volunteers
	viewed standardized pictures with either neutral or unpleasant
                  content.
	Simultaneously, one of three treatments was administered in a
                  randomized,
	double-blind crossover design: the CCKb receptor agonist
                  pentagastrin
	(0.1 $\mu$g/kg), the mu-opioid receptor agonist
                  remifentanil (0.0625$\mu$g/kg),
	or saline. Self-ratings of the emotional experience of
                  pictures and
	drugs were sampled together with psychological tests and
                  recording
	of heart rate. Results&nbsp;&nbsp;Pentagastrin treatment
                  increased
	the rating of unpleasantness for both neutral and unpleasant
                  pictures,
	while it decreased the rating of pleasantness for the neutral
                  pictures.
	These effects did not correlate with the degree of general
                  unpleasantness
	induced by the drug. Remifentanil treatment increased the
                  pleasantness
	for the neutral pictures. While pentagastrin treatment induced
                  a
	heart rate increase, unpleasant pictures induced a heart rate
                  decrease,
	and the magnitude of change in heart rate correlated
                  positively for
	these conditions. Conclusions&nbsp;&nbsp;This study shows that
                  the
	CCK and the opioid system modulate how external stimuli are
                  emotionally
	perceived, suggesting a possible involvement in affective

                  data from
	multicentre trials that would be difficult to achieve by other

	This paper illustrates some useful applications of Bayesian
                  methods
	to the analysis of multicentre trials, with emphasis on
                  insights
	that would be difficult to obtain using conventional
                  frequentist
	methods. Two trials provide data for illustration: a large
                  multicentre
	trial comparing two doses of a drug with placebo with respect
                  to
	an essentially continuous measurement for which the original
                  analysis
	revealed a significant treatment by centre effect, and a large
                  multicentre
	trial with intraclass correlation induced by a categorical
                  outcome
	of up to four episodes of heartburn reported by individual
                  patients.
	The data from both trials had been analysed previously using
                  conventional
	frequentist methods. Both sets of data were reanalysed using
                  Bayesian
	and empirical Bayesian methods; all of the analyses provided
                  the
	same conclusions for the key questions regarding treatment
                  differences.
	The Bayesian methods provided some insights useful for model
                  checking
	and also provided a way to explore some important quantitative
                  aspects

	surgery in the University Hospital of Lausanne,
                  Switzerland. RESULTS:
	Physicians predicted "a great improvement" of quality of life
                  after

                  others); 39%

                  improvement."
	Correlations between physician expectation and various

                  completed
	a baseline practice session during which they were given no
                  drink.
	During two of the sessions, subjects were given a drink
                  containing
	50 g glucose and on the other two they were given a drink
                  containing

	comprised a 6 min visual analogue of the Bakan vigilance task,

	a placebo purported to either block anxiety or enhance

                  pro-
	and anti-American essays as a measure of worldview
                  defense. Although
	mortality salience intensified worldview defense in the
                  memory-enhancer
	condition, this effect was completely eliminated in the
                  anxiety-blocker
	condition. The results suggest that some psychological
                  defenses serve
	to avert the experience of anxiety rather than to ameliorate

                  sensitivity
	analysis plays an important role in the analysis. We
                  illustrate the
	methods in the context of a case study. We consider survival
                  times
	(e.g., time to recurrence of depression) from a clinical
                  trial. Because
	of the nature of the application we consider a mixture model
                  that
	allows for a "surviving fraction." A Bayesian treatment of
                  this model
	has been considered previously by Chen, Hill, Greenhouse and
                  Fayos
	(1985), Greenhouse and Paul (1995) and Stangl (1991). In this
                  paper,
	we are concerned with the question: does treatment effect both
                  the
	probability of being a survivor and the survival times of
                  "non-survivors"?
	The question is cast as a model selection problem. Reference
                  priors
	give rise to improper posteriors and, moreover, do not lead to
                  well
	defined Bayes factors. We adapt the idea of Kass and Wasserman
                  (1995)
	who proposed "unit information priors." These priors are
                  somewhat
	ad-hoc. To address this concern, we perform a sensitivity
                  analysis
	with respect to the priors. We also consider case
                  influence. Our
	conclusion is that treatment is important for determining long
                  term
	survival but, among short term survivors, treatment may be
                  less predictive

                  outside the
	scope of biomedicine. The question is: Do they represent a
                  serious
	challenge to the biomedical understanding of bodily processes?

                  the
	possibility of a fully developed mind-body medicine think very
                  likely.
	This paper by Roger Hahn, an epidemiologist at the US Centers
                  for
	Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, deals with the dark
                  side
	of the placebo, the nocebo. The placebo makes good things
                  happen,
	the nocebo makes bad things happen. For reasons that Hahn does
                  not
	discuss, the nocebo did not receive a name until 1961 (even
                  though
	Walter Cannon talked about an extreme from of nocebo,
                  so-called voodoo
	death, in a famous paper he wrote in 1942), and "the nocebo
                  phenomenon
	has not been systematically assessed and explained." This is
                  basically
	what Hahn sets out to do. Hahn is trained as an anthropologist
                  as
	well as an epidemiologist, and he is especially interested in
                  the
	cultural dimensions of the nocebo. The paper was first
                  presented
	at a three-day conference at Harvard, in 1994. The
                  presentations
	have been gathered in The Placebo Effect: An Interdisciplinary
                  Exploration
	(Harvard University Press 1997), edited by Anne Harrington,
                  who in
	her introduction makes at least two assessments worth
                  quoting. First,
	"Placebos are the ghosts that haunt our house of biomedical
                  objectivity."
	Second: Placebos "are not only puzzles to be 'solved,' but
                  	to the extent that they elude ready solutions
                   they also
	teach us how far we still are from closure on the question of
                  what
	it will mean to create a science subtle and complex enough to
                  encompass
	all that is entailed in being human." [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

	who reported a pilot study on the influence of subliminal
                  knowledge
	of future events on brain processing in brain areas believed
                  to be
	involved in the placebo effect. It was reasoned that if the
                  mechanisms
	uncovered are active, then a person should be able to
                  subconsciously
	choose cure and restoration of health, rather than continuing
                  sickness.
	Thus, Radin and Lobach reasoned, the placebo effect may have a
                  psychic
	component, involving "retrocausal influences from the future."
                  Two
	comments on this scenario are made: first, on the question of
                  "choice";
	second on the nature of cause and effect in such world
                  models. People
	who are familiar with traditional and complementary medicine
                  assume
	that all healing, including the placebo effect, is effected by
                  activation
	of the energy body, at least those factors required to reverse
                  the
	pathology concerned. Radin and Lobach's proposed

	mechanism should be able to do so. If it does, it should apply
                  more
	generally than just to placebo effect: If we can choose
                  health, we
	will do so even when we are not yet sick. This mechanism could
                  contribute

                  trials in which

                  a statistically
	significant manner, the placebo response has important
                  implications.
	These implications relate to the nature of illness, the study
                  of
	non-specific factors in the treatment setting that are related
                  to
	clinical improvement, methods of enhancing these non-specific
                  sources
	of benefit, and the neurobiology that is associated with the
                  placebo
	response. Specific sources of clinical improvement in medical
                  and
	psychological treatment generally consist of drugs or clear
                  interventions
	(e.g., surgery, specific therapeutic modalities) that appear
                  to directly
	contribute to the desired treatment. Non-specific factors, on
                  the
	other hand, include the clinician-patient relationship,
                  installation
	of hope, relationship with authority, and other such factors
                  that
	are more implicit to treatment and may contribute to the
                  placebo
	response. Our understanding of how these non-specific aspects
                  of
	treatment relate to clinical improvement and ways of enhancing
                  these
	non-pharmacological elements of therapy may form important
                  aspects
	of treatment. Furthermore, an important, albeit potentially
                  overlooked
	element of the placebo response are clinical-trial designs and
                  methodologies,
	themselves. Specific neurobiological changes also appear to be
                  associated
	with the placebo response in at least some cases. Finally, it
                  is
	suggested that the placebo response may in some instances
                  represent
	a type of brain plasticity in which expectation and desire--
                  agency--can
	result in specific changes in brain function that either may

                  that vitamin
	C supplementation alleviates the symptoms of the common cold,
                  but
	widespread skepticism that vitamin C could have any
                  significant effect
	remains. One of the most influential common cold studies,
                  published
	in 1975, was carried out by Thomas Karlowski et al. at the
                  National
	Institutes of Health. Their placebo consisted of lactose,
                  which can
	easily be distinguished from ascorbic acid by taste. Karlowski
                  et
	al. found a 17% decrease in the duration of cold episodes in
                  the
	group administered vitamin C (6 g/day); however, they
                  suggested that
	the decrease was entirely due to the placebo effect. In this
                  article
	it will be shown that the placebo effect is not a valid
                  explanation
	for the results of the Karlowski study, as it is inconsistent
                  with
	their results. This is an important conclusion for two
                  reasons. First,
	the placebo explanation becomes even more unreasonable as
                  regards
	the reported benefits found in several other studies with
                  valid placebo
	tablets. Second, as the results from the Karlowski study are
                  not
	due to the placebo effect, their results can be used to assess
                  the
	quantitative effects of vitamin C supplementation. The most
                  important
	conclusions from Karlowski's study are that therapeutic
                  vitamin C
	supplementation during a common cold episode appears to be as

	The authors suggest that placebo responses are too high in

	clinical characteristics differentially predict favorable
                  treatment
	response to divalproex versus placebo for impulsive aggression
                  in
	patients with borderline personality disorder. METHOD:
                  Fifty-two
	outpatients with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder were
                  randomly
	assigned to receive divalproex (N=20) or placebo (N=32),
                  double-blind,
	for 12 weeks. Trait impulsivity symptoms were determined by
                  using
	the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and state aggression symptoms
                  were
	determined by using the Overt Aggression Scale modified for
                  outpatients.
	Affective stability was determined by using the Young Mania
                  Rating
	Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Analyses were
                  performed
	to identify possible baseline symptom domains that predict
                  treatment
	response. RESULTS: Divalproex was superior to placebo in
                  reducing
	impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality
                  disorder.
	Divalproex-treated patients responded better than
                  placebo-treated
	patients among those with higher baseline trait impulsivity
                  symptoms
	and state aggression symptoms. The effects of baseline trait
                  impulsivity
	and state aggression appear to be independent of one
                  another. However,
	baseline affective instability did not influence differential
                  treatment
	response. CONCLUSIONS: Both pretreatment trait impulsivity
                  symptoms
	and state aggression symptoms predict a favorable response to
                  divalproex

	differences in symptom levels between drug and placebo were
                  modest
	at best. This led the authors to suggest that either
                  medication effects
	are trivial or that new designs are needed that do not assume
                  additive
	effects. We suggest that not all patients necessarily respond
                  to
	a given medication and that effect sizes based on the
                  "average" patient
	may underestimate drug-placebo differences for those who
                  do. Data
	submitted to the FDA can also underestimate how a drug will
                  perform
	in clinic practice, as studies sometimes are designed as much
                  for
	marketing purposes as they are to estimate the magnitude of a
                  medication's
	effects. Finally, even when drug-placebo differences are
                  small, antidepressant
	medication remains a potent treatment that typically matches
                  or exceeds
	the efficacy of alternative interventions. (PsycINFO Database

	review of randomized clinical trials that compared placebo
                  with no
	treatment (see record 2001-06847-001). Based on 11 trials,
                  B. E.
	Wampold et al. concluded that "the placebo effect is robust"
                  (p.

                  evidence
	in general that placebos have powerful clinical effects"
                  (p. 1599).
	In this commentary, we examine the reasons for this
                  discrepancy.
	For trials with continuous outcomes, our analyses (82 trials)
                  and
	that of B. E. Wampold et al. (5 trials) resulted in pooled
                  standardized

                  confidence
	interval = -0.52 to - 0.06) . There was considerable risk of
                  bias
	(e.g., reporting bias, sample-size bias). Similarly, for
                  trials with
	binary outcomes, our analysis (32 trials) and that of
                  B. E. Wampold
	et al. (6 trials) found no statistically significant pooled
                  effect
	of placebo interventions and were essentially identical:
                  relative
	risk 0.95 (95% confidence interval = 0.88-1.02) versus odds
                  ratio
	0.99 (95% confidence interval = 0.81 -1.23). Thus,
                  B. E. Wampold
	et al.'s conclusion was not substantiated by their data, and
                  is best

                  improve patient
	reported and observer reported outcomes, but this belief is
                  not based
	on evidence from randomised trials that compare placebo with
                  no treatment.
	OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of placebo
                  interventions. SEARCH
	STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register
                  (The
	Cochrane Library, issue 3, 1998), MEDLINE (Jan 1966 to Dec
                  1998),
	EMBASE (Jan 1980 to Dec 1998), Biological Abstracts (Jan 1986
                  to
	Dec 1998), PsycLIT (Jan 1887 to Dec 1998). Experts on placebo
                  research
	were contacted and references in the included trials were
                  read. SELECTION
	CRITERIA: Randomised placebo trials with a no-treatment
                  control group
	investigating any health problem were included. DATA
                  COLLECTION AND
	ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality
                  and
	extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional
                  information.
	MAIN RESULTS: Outcome data were available in 114 out of 130
                  included
	trials, investigating 40 clinical conditions. Outcomes were
                  binary
	in 32 trials (3795 patients) and continuous in 82 (4730
                  patients).
	We found no statistically significant pooled effect of placebo
                  in
	studies with binary outcomes, relative risk 0.95 (95 per cent
                  confidence
	interval 0.88 to 1.02). The pooled relative risk for
                  subjective (patient
	reported) outcomes was 0.95 (0.86 to 1.05) and for objective
                  (observer
	reported) outcomes 0.91 (0.80 to 1.04). There was
                  statistically significant
	heterogeneity (P < 0.03), but no evidence of sample size bias
                  (P
	= 0.56). We found an overall positive effect of placebo
                  treatments
	in trials with continuous outcomes, standardised mean
                  difference
	-0.28 (95 per cent confidence interval -0.38 to -0.19). The
                  standardised
	mean difference for subjective outcomes was -0.36 (-0.47 to
                  -0.25),
	whereas no statistically significant effect was found for
                  objective
	outcomes, standardised mean difference -0.12 (-0.27 to
                  0.03). There
	was statistically significant heterogeneity (P < 0.001), and
                  evidence
	of sample size bias (P = 0.05). There was no statistically
                  significant
	effect of placebo interventions in eight out of nine clinical
                  conditions
	investigated in three trials or more (nausea, relapse in
                  prevention
	of smoking and depression, overweight, asthma, hypertension,
                  insomnia
	and anxiety), but confidence intervals were wide. There was a
                  modest
	apparent analgesic effect of placebo interventions,
                  standardised
	mean difference -0.27 (-0.40 to -0.15), but also a substantial
                  risk
	of bias. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that
                  placebo
	interventions in general have clinically important effects. A
                  possible
	moderate effect on subjective continuous outcomes, especially
                  pain,
	could not be clearly distinguished from bias.},

	with many diseases, but the quality of the evidence supporting
                  this
	finding has not been rigorously evaluated. METHODS: We
                  conducted
	a systematic review of clinical trials in which patients were
                  randomly
	assigned to either placebo or no treatment. A placebo could be
                  pharmacologic
	(e.g., a tablet), physical (e.g., a manipulation), or
                  psychological
	(e.g., a conversation). RESULTS: We identified 130 trials that
                  met
	our inclusion criteria. After the exclusion of 16 trials
                  without
	relevant data on outcomes, there were 32 with binary outcomes
                  (involving
	3795 patients, with a median of 51 patients per trial) and 82
                  with
	continuous outcomes (involving 4730 patients, with a median of
                  27
	patients per trial). As compared with no treatment, placebo
                  had no
	significant effect on binary outcomes (pooled relative risk of
                  an
	unwanted outcome with placebo, 0.95; 95 percent confidence
                  interval,
	0.88 to 1.02), regardless of whether these outcomes were
                  subjective
	or objective. For the trials with continuous outcomes, placebo
                  had
	a beneficial effect (pooled standardized mean difference in
                  the value
	for an unwanted outcome between the placebo and untreated
                  groups,
	-0.28; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.38 to -0.19), but
                  the effect
	decreased with increasing sample size, indicating a possible
                  bias
	related to the effects of small trials. The pooled
                  standardized mean
	difference was significant for the trials with subjective
                  outcomes
	(-0.36; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.47 to -0.25) but
                  not for
	those with objective outcomes. In 27 trials involving the
                  treatment
	of pain, placebo had a beneficial effect (-0.27; 95 percent
                  confidence
	interval, -0.40 to -0.15). This corresponded to a reduction in
                  the
	intensity of pain of 6.5 mm on a 100-mm visual-analogue
                  scale. CONCLUSIONS:
	We found little evidence in general that placebos had powerful
                  clinical
	effects. Although placebos had no significant effects on
                  objective
	or binary outcomes, they had possible small benefits in
                  studies with
	continuous subjective outcomes and for the treatment of
                  pain. Outside
	the setting of clinical trials, there is no justification for
                  the
	use of placebos.},

                  91-100. It is widely
                  believed
	that placebo interventions induce powerful effects. We could
                  not
	confirm this in a systematic review of 114 randomized trials
                  that
	compared placebo-treated with untreated patients. To study
                  whether
	a new sample of trials would reproduce our earlier findings,
                  and
	to update the review. Systematic review of trials that were
                  published
	since our last search (or not previously identified), and of
                  all
	available trials. Data was available in 42 out of 52 new
                  trials (3212
	patients). The results were similar to our previous
                  findings. The
	updated review summarizes data from 156 trials (11 737
                  patients).
	We found no statistically significant pooled effect in 38
                  trials
	with binary outcomes, relative risk 0.95 (95\% confidence
                  interval

                  continuous outcomes decreased with
	increasing sample size, and there was considerable variation
                  in effect
	also between large trials; the effect estimates should
                  therefore
	be interpreted cautiously. If this bias is disregarded, the
                  pooled
	standardized mean difference in 118 trials with continuous
                  outcomes

                  trials
	or more, placebo had a statistically significant pooled effect

  abstract = {Therapists are unable to provide a comprehensive account
                  of therapy
	as an intelligible activity. This is at least partly due to
                  the unresolved
	problem of explaining how phenomenology is even possible. An
                  alternative
	to providing a comprehensive account of therapy is to take the
                  fact
	of phenomenology for granted and provide just an outline
                  account
	of how therapy heals. One way this can be achieved is to set
                  therapy
	in the context of medical anthropology which will facilitate a
                  view
	of therapy as just another healing ritual. Insight into how
                  healing
	rituals heal is provided in this paper by a long and in-depth
                  look
	at the so-called 'paradox' of the placebo effect. This will
                  reveal
	the so-called 'placebo effect' as a misunderstood, modern
                  example
	of healing ritual self-healing. In fact, the single term
                  'placebo
	effect' will be abandoned and replaced by the two concepts of
                  'SMCH'
	('specifically modified consultation and health care') and
                  'RMH'
	('response to modified health care'). These two concepts
                  provide
	an outline explanation of how all healing rituals heal and so
                  provide
	an outline explanation of how the healing ritual of therapy
                  heals,
	also. At least one problem arises out of explaining therapy as
                  healing
	ritual self-healing, namely that this conception conflictswith
                  the
	idea in therapy circles that, in therapy, it is the
                  relationship
	that counts. Nonetheless, it will be maintained that the
                  purpose
	of therapy is healing, that the healing that is achieved is
                  self-healing
	and that its fulfilment is not dependent upon one-to-one
                  relationships.
	Finally, it will be argued that the further development of
                  therapy
	requires a better understanding of what aids and obstructs
                  psychoemotional
	self-healing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of European

	side effects were negatively correlated with changes in

	cordance at end of placebo lead-in (r = -0.67, p < 0.003), at
                  2 weeks

	In their article, Shiv, Carmon, and Ariely document for the
                  first
	time that nonconscious expectations about the relationship
                  between
	price and quality can influence consumers in a placebo-like
                  manner.
	Even when the price paid for a good has absolutely no
                  relationship
	to its actual quality, consumers' nonconscious beliefs about
                  the
	price-quality relationship change their actual experience with
                  the
	good. Broadly speaking, a placebo has been defined in the
                  medical
	literature as "a substance or procedure that has no inherent
                  power
	to produce an effect that is sought or expected". We find that
                  the

	consumers) the arousing effects of an energy drink. Taken

	our study results and the Shiv et al study results provide

  volume = {7 Suppl 1},
  pages = {S83-92},
  abstract = {There are key differences between mind-body medicine and
                  alternative
	medicine. A central tenet of mind-body medicine is the
                  recognition
	that the mind plays a key role in health and that any presumed
                  separation
	of mind and body is false. Alternative medicine, however, does
                  not
	focus on the role of thoughts and emotions in health and,
                  therefore,
	is separate from mind-body medicine. Also, while there has
                  been little
	scientific research on alternative medicine, the literature on
                  mind-body
	medicine comprises more than 2000 peer-reviewed studies
                  published
	in the past 25 years. The groundwork for understanding the
                  physiology
	of mind-body interactions was established by pioneering
                  studies in
	the 1930s by Walter Cannon, and in the 1950s by Walter Hess
                  and by
	Hans Selye that led to an understanding of the fight-or-flight
                  response.
	Later work by Holmes and Rahe documented measurable
                  relationships
	between stressful life events and illness. Other research has
                  shown
	clinical improvement in patients treated with a placebo for a
                  variety
	of medical problems. The effectiveness of placebo treatment
                  can be
	interpreted as compelling evidence that expectation and belief
                  can
	affect physiological response. Recent studies using spectral
                  analysis
	and topographic electroencephalographic (EEG) mapping of the
                  relaxation
	response demonstrate that by changing mental activity we can
                  demonstrate
	measurable changes in central nervous system activity. These,
                  and
	other, studies demonstrate that mind-body interactions are
                  real and

	In this study, using a within-subject design, we combined
                  functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an
                  expectation/conditioning
	manipulation model to investigate the neural substrates of
                  nocebo
	hyperalgesia using heat pain on the right forearm. Thirteen
                  subjects
	completed the study. Results showed that, after administering
                  inert
	treatment, subjective pain intensity ratings increased

	more on nocebo regions compared with the control regions in

                  analysis
	of hyperalgesic nocebo responses to identical calibrated
                  noxious
	stimuli showed signal increases in brain regions including
                  bilateral
	dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, superior

                  hippocampus;
	right claustrum/putamen, lateral prefrontal gyrus, and middle
                  temporal
	gyrus. Functional connectivity analysis of spontaneous
                  resting-state
	fMRI data from the same cohort of subjects showed a
                  correlation between
	two seed regions (left frontal operculum and hippocampus) and
                  pain
	network including bilateral insula, operculum, ACC, and left
                  S1/M1.
	In conclusion, we found evidence that nocebo hyperalgesia may
                  be
	predominantly produced through an affective- cognitive pain
                  pathway
	(medial pain system), and the left hippocampus may play an

	could be mediated via modulation of stress. METHODS: Ischemic
                  pain
	was induced in healthy volunteers (N = 59). When pain reached
                  "7"
	on a 10-point scale, two groups of subjects received
                  information
	that a pain relieving (the Placebo group) or a pain increasing
                  (the
	Nocebo group) substance was injected. All injections contained
                  physiological
	saline. A third group received no information and no injection
                  (the
	Natural History group). Pain ratings and blood samples for
                  analysis
	of cortisol and beta-endorphin were obtained every 5 minutes
                  after
	pain equal to seven until the experiment was
                  terminated. RESULTS:
	Pain increased in all groups, but there were significantly
                  lower
	pain ratings in the Placebo group at 15 minutes after the
                  injection,
	compared with the other two groups. Cortisol increased in all
                  groups,
	but mostly so in the Nocebo group. Circulating beta-endorphin
                  increased
	in all groups. Pain-ratings were not correlated with

                  pain
	level, was seen in the Placebo group at 15 minutes after the
                  injection.
	The placebo response was not related to stress or to
                  beta-endorphin.
	Expectation of a pain increase in the Nocebo group led to an
                  increase

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Only two thirds of patients with major
                  depression (MD)
	respond to antidepressants. Thus, far applicable predictors of
                  responsiveness
	to selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have not
                  been
	found. Cumulative evidence linking serotonergic depletion and
                  cognition
	led us to hypothesize that the neuropsychological functioning
                  of
	major depression patients may predict their responsiveness to
                  SSRI
	antidepressants. METHODS: Fifty-five patients meeting DSM-IV
                  criteria
	for major depression and strict inclusion and exclusion
                  criteria
	underwent an extensive clinical and neuropsychological
                  assessment
	prior to the initiation of selective serotonergic
                  treatment. Following
	6 weeks of treatment, severity of depression was reassessed,
                  yielding
	a responsiveness score by which classification of each subject
                  as
	a responder or nonresponder was made. The study was double
                  blind.
	RESULTS: Logistic regression yielded neuropsychological
                  indices,
	which significantly predicted the probability of depressed
                  patients
	to respond favorably to SSRIs. Responders were characterized
                  by better
	functioning in "simple" tasks and by worse functioning in
                  "complex"
	tasks compared to nonresponders. No differences were found for
                  more
	lateralized right or left hemisphere functions between
                  responders
	and nonresponders. LIMITATIONS: Drug treatment comprised of
                  SSRIs
	but was not standardized. Responsiveness was assessed
                  following 6
	weeks of treatment providing for initial amelioration rather
                  than
	full remission. Placebo response was not controlled for. These
                  limitations
	may influence the interpretation of the findings. CONCLUSIONS:
                  The
	present findings suggest that responders and nonresponders to
                  SSRIs
	might be distinguished by their neuropsychological functioning

  abstract = {This review article presents the evidence that the
                  antiinflammatory
	actions of acupuncture are mediated via the reflexive central
                  inhibition
	of the innate immune system. Both laboratory and clinical
                  evidence
	have recently shown the existence of a negative feedback loop
                  between
	the autonomic nervous system and the innate immunity. There is
                  also
	experimental evidence that the electrical stimulation of the
                  vagus
	nerve inhibits macrophage activation and the production of
                  TNF, IL-1{beta}
	, IL-6, IL-18, and other proinflammatory cytokines. It is
                  therefore
	conceivable that along with hypnosis, meditation, prayer,
                  guided
	imagery, biofeedback, and the placebo effect, the systemic
                  anti-inflammatory
	actions of traditional and electro-acupuncture are directly or
                  indirectly
	mediated by the efferent vagus nerve activation and
                  inflammatory
	macrophage deactivation. In view of this common physiological
                  mediation,
	assessing the clinical efficacy of a specific acupuncture
                  regimen
	using conventional double-blind placebo-controlled trials
                  inherently
	lacks objectivity due to (1) the uncertainty of ancient rules
                  for
	needle placement, (2) the diffuse noxious inhibitory control
                  triggered
	by control-needling at irrelevant points, (3) the possibility
                  of
	a dose-response relationship between stimulation and effects,
                  and
	(4) the possibility of inadequate blinding using an inert sham
                  procedure.
	A more objective assessment of its efficacy could perhaps
                  consist
	of measuring its effects on the surrogate markers of autonomic
                  tone
	and inflammation. The use of acupuncture as an adjunct therapy
                  to
	conventional medical treatment for a number of chronic
                  inflammatory
	and autoimmune diseases seems plausible and should be

  abstract = {Background Placebos are hypothesized to exert positive
                  effects on
	medical conditions by enhancing patient expectancies. Recent
                  reviews
	suggest that placebo benefits are restricted to subjective
                  responses,
	like pain, but might be ineffective for objective physiologic
                  outcomes.
	Nevertheless, mind-body links and placebo responsivity in
                  asthma
	are widely believed to exist.Objective We carried out a
                  randomized,
	double-blind investigation to (1) determine whether placebo
                  can suppress
	airway hyperreactivity in asthmatic subjects, (2) quantify the
                  placebo
	effect, (3) identify predictors of the placebo response, and
                  (4)
	determine whether physician interventions modify the placebo
                  response.Methods
	In a double-blind, crossover design investigation,
                  55 subjects with
	mild intermittent and persistent asthma with stable airway
                  hyperreactivity
	were randomized to placebo or salmeterol before serial
                  methacholine
	challenges. Subjects were additionally randomized to physician
                  interactions
	that communicated either positive or neutral expectancies
                  regarding
	drug effect.Results Placebo bronchodilator administration
                  significantly
	reduced bronchial hyperreactivity compared with baseline (the
                  calculated
	concentration of methacholine required to induce a 20%
                  decrease in
	FEV1 nearly doubled); 18% of subjects were placebo responders
                  by
	using conservative definitions. Experimental manipulation of
                  physician
	behavior altered perceptions of the physician but not the
                  magnitude
	or frequency of the placebo response.Conclusions Objective
                  placebo
	effects exist in asthma. These responses are of significant
                  magnitude
	and likely to be meaningful clinically. The placebo response
                  was
	not modulated by alterations in physician behavior in this
                  study.Clinical
	implications The placebo response in patients with asthma is
                  important
	in understanding the limitations of clinical research studies
                  and
	in maximizing safe and effective therapies. This article
                  confirms
	the existence of a strong placebo response in an objective and

	their intention to obtain a generic drug again? These

  abstract = {Pain is usually a source of warning and protection; this
                  is not the
	case for chronic pain. The experience of pain is a form of
                  consciousness
	consisting of integrated physical and psychological neural
                  inputs.
	It typically originates with the spinal transmission of
                  noxious sensory
	stimuli arising from damaged tissues; this level of processing
                  is
	termed nociception. Signals are conveyed from the spinal cord
                  to
	supraspinal networks that include the brainstem, subcortical,
                  and
	cortical regions. This processing network is termed the pain
                  neuromatrix.
	It is the supraspinal network that transforms the sensation of
                  nociception
	into the complex and uniquely individual experience that is
                  pain.
	Pain modulation (inhibitory or facilitatory) is emerging as an
                  important
	clinical target for pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic
                  interventions.
	This chapter outlines the neuroanatomical and physiological
                  mechanisms
	underlying the experience of acute (physiological) and chronic
                  (pathological)
	pain. It also highlights the theoretical role of CAM
                  techniques in
	pain modulation. Finally, in order to provide an integrative
                  view
	of pain perception, the dimensions of the pain experience are
                  presented
	and contrasted, including the discriminative, cognitive, and
                  affective
	elements.},

                  obsessive-compulsive
	disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),
                  depression, post-traumatic
	stress disorder, panic) varied in response to both placebo and
                  active
	drug treatments. Response to placebo was high among patients
                  participating
	in GAD, depression, and panic disorder clinical
                  trials. Conversely,
	patients participating in psychotic disorder and OCD trials
                  experienced
	low response to placebo. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate
                  that the
	magnitude of placebo response and drug response were
                  heterogeneous
	and were statistically significantly different among various
                  psychiatric
	disorders. Although a noticeable degree of heterogeneity was
                  detected
	in the drug-placebo ratio among various disorders, the
                  differences
	did not reach statistical significance. This finding suggests
                  that
	placebo use should be continued for newer agents being tested
                  for
	all of the psychiatric disorders. These findings may help in
                  the
	development of psychopharmacology trial designs and in the
                  deliberations
	of ethics committees.},

  abstract = {Since 1955, when HK Beecher published his classic "The
                  Powerful Placebo,"
	it generally has been accepted that 35% of patients with any
                  of a
	wide variety of disorders can be treated with placebos
                  alone. In
	recent years, average cure rates of 70%, and up to 100%, also
                  have
	been quoted. Like pharmacological preparations, placebos are
                  credited
	with possessing time-effect curves; cumulation and carry-over
                  effects;
	differentiated actions depending on color, size, or packaging;
                  even
	toxic effects. It has been postulated that placebos can
                  prolong life,
	that their effects occur in surgery as well as in medicine,
                  and that
	they are mediated by endorphins. In this article source
                  material
	that forms the scientific basis for such claims is
                  examined. Analysis
	shows that the studies on which such ideas are based, except
                  perhaps
	in bronchial asthma, do not in any way justify the conclusions
                  drawn
	from them. The truth is that the placebo effect is
                  counterfeited
	by a variety of factors including the natural history of the
                  disease,
	regression to the mean, concomitant treatments, obliging
                  reports,
	experimental subordination, severe methodological defects in
                  the
	studies, misquotations, etc; even, on occasion, by the fact
                  that
	the supposed placebo is actually not a placebo, but has to be
                  acknowledged
	as having a specific action on the condition for which it is
                  being
	given. A further reason for misjudgment is the lack of clarity
                  of
	the placebo concept itself. Experimental subordination and
                  conditioning
	are other areas of insufficient conceptual
                  differentiation. The authors
	conclude that the literature relating to the magnitude and
                  frequency
	of the placebo effect is unfounded and grossly overrated, if
                  not
	entirely false. They pose the question whether the existence
                  of the
	so-called placebo effect is itself not largely-or indeed
                  totally-illusory.},

	drug and placebo effects. The following topics are covered:
                  (1) definitions
	of placebo and the placebo effect, (2) evaluations of the
                  placebo
	effect, (3) evidence of placebo effects, and (4) whether there
                  is
	a powerful antidepressant drug effect. Their concern was not
                  to assess
	the placebo effect but rather to examine the magnitude of the
                  drug
	effect. The authors expected a substantial placebo effect, but
                  were
	surprised by the small medication effect that they found. It
                  is suggested
	that their analysis of FDA data is likely to prove
                  controversial,
	and although the difference in response between antidepressant
                  medication
	and inert placebo was statistically significant, in clinical
                  terms
	it was very small, leading Kirsch et al to ask whether these
                  medications
	are "the emperor's new drugs." (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

                  frontotemporal
	gray matter, subcortical gray matter structures, and
                  cerebellum.
	The MRI responses were significantly different for the two
                  drugs
	applied (p = 0.01). Relative to signal strength during
                  injection,
	metamphetamine elicited a signal increase of 0.97 +/- 0.03%
                  (mean
	+/- SD, p = 0.02) within the whole section 4-5 min after
                  injection.
	Similarly, both placebo conditions led to a small signal
                  increase,
	i.e. 0.50 +/- 0. 03% (n.s.) for the metamphetamine placebo and

                  substantially increased
	in 2006 and 2007, and more and more medical and psychological
                  subspecialties
	have added empirical data to our knowledge. RECENT FINDINGS:
                  The
	theoretical framework of our understanding of the placebo
                  response
	needs extension to account for findings that cannot be
                  attributed
	to (Pavlovian) conditioning or suggestions alone. In addition,
                  imaging
	studies need to address individual responses rather than group
                  means,
	and to expand beyond experimental pain research. Gender
                  aspects have
	been demonstrated for the placebo response but still widely
                  ignored,
	especially in neurophysiological studies. It has been shown
                  that
	nocebo research needs a methodological and ethical framework
                  that
	allows its exploration. Finally, analyses of clinical trial
                  data,
	either as metaanalyses or as reanalyses of trial raw data, may
                  allow
	us to identify factors that subsequently can be used in
                  experimental
	work. SUMMARY: Novel findings will allow better planning of
                  clinical
	drug trials, better handling of clinical trial data in the
                  future,
	and finally, may eventually result in improved patient

	thermal stimuli. This finding was mainly the result of highly
                  significant
	analgesia in 5 of the 11 subjects who completed the 5-session
                  study.
	Of the 5 responders, 2 responded only to electroacupuncture
                  and 3
	only to manual acupuncture, suggesting that acupuncture's
                  analgesic
	effects on experimental pain may be dependent on both subject
                  and
	mode. We developed a simple quantitative assessment tool, the
                  Subjective
	Acupuncture Sensation Scale (SASS), comprised of 9 descriptors
                  and
	an anxiety measure to study the relationship between the deqi
                  sensation
	induced by acupuncture and the putative therapeutic effects of
                  acupuncture.
	The SASS results confirm that the deqi sensation is complex,
                  with
	all subjects rating multiple descriptors during each mode. We
                  found
	significant correlations of analgesia with SASS ratings of
                  numbness
	and soreness, but not with ratings of stabbing, throbbing,
                  tingling,
	burning, heaviness, fullness, or aching. This suggests that
                  attributes
	of the deqi sensation may be useful clinical indicators of
                  effective
	treatment. PERSPECTIVE: The results of this study indicate the
                  existence
	of both individual subject and acupuncture mode variability in
                  the
	analgesic effects of acupuncture. This suggests that switching
                  acupuncture
	mode may be a treatment option for unresponsive patients.},

                  itself of a variety
	of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)
                  interventions. Allopathic

	there is no sound scientific evidence that has established its
                  utility.
	However, although not widely appreciated, there are thousands
                  of
	randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have addressed the
                  efficacy
	of CAM. We reviewed the RCTs of herbal and other natural
                  products,
	acupuncture, and homeopathy as examples of typical CAM
                  modalities,
	focusing on conditions of interest to
                  gastroenterologists. Peppermint
	(alone or in combination) has supportive evidence for use in
                  patients
	with dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and as an
                  intraluminal

                  appeared
	to be effective in relieving nausea and vomiting due to motion

	diarrhea due to antibiotics; one particular formulation

                  nausea
	and vomiting and might be useful elsewhere. There is even a
                  suggestion
	that homeopathy has efficacy in treatment of gastrointestinal
                  problems
	or symptoms. The major problem in interpreting these CAM data

	the generally low quality of the RCTs, although that quality
                  might
	not be different compared to RCTs in the general medical
                  literature.

                  questionable
	practice implying deceit and paternalism. However, in recent

	there has been an increasing amount of rigorous research into

                  believed to
	be the basis of the premodern pharmacopoeia, the placebo has
                  been
	adopted in practice as a harmless but unscientific approach

	The possible role of the placebo response as a functional

                  constructed to
	explore the logical properties of autogenetic (self-fulfilling
                  and
	self-negating) beliefs. The language enables us to distinguish
                  among
	types of autogenesis which have previously been regarded as
                  identical,
	and to describe new types which have not yet been discussed in
                  the
	experimental literature. The analysis proceeds in three
                  stages. The
	first stage deals with individual autogenetic processes,
                  wherein
	a single person's belief system has an effect on the truth or
                  falsehood
	of what is believed (e.g. the placebo effect). The second
                  stage deals
	with social processes in which the belief systems of two or
                  more
	individuals have an autogenetic effect that cannot be produced
                  by
	any single belief system in isolation (e.g. a run on the
                  banks).
	The third stage deals with higher-order processes in which a
                  belief
	about one's own involvement in an autogenetic processes has
                  itself
	a further and more complicated autogenetic effect
                  (e.g. faith-healing).
	Higher-order autogenesis has paradoxical consequences that
                  raise
	fundamental questions about the nature and scope of empirical
                  knowledge.},

	processes that mediate the placebo response. At the same time,
                  questions

                  treatment can
	be investigated by administering therapies either overtly or
                  covertly,
	without the administration of any placebo. Here, we analyze
                  the effects
	of open (i.e., expected) versus hidden (i.e., unexpected)
                  stimulations
	of the human subthalamic region on autonomic responses in
                  Parkinson
	patients. To do this, we mapped the whole subthalamic region,
                  from
	the dorsal to the ventral part, and recorded both heart rate
                  and
	sympathetic responses by using spectral analysis of heart rate
                  variability.
	We found that open stimulations were more effective than
                  hidden ones
	only in the ventral subthalamic region, whereas no difference
                  between
	the two conditions was found in the dorsal aspect. By
                  analyzing the
	stimulus-response curves in the dorsal, middle, and ventral
                  subthalamic
	regions, we found that the autonomic response threshold was
                  higher
	in the hidden than open condition for both heart rate and
                  sympathetic
	responses only in the ventral part. As this ventralmost
                  portion of
	the subthalamic region is involved in associative-limbic
                  functions,
	these data suggest that expectation enhances autonomic
                  responses
	only if these are elicited in the limbic system. These results

                  major
	role in the therapeutic outcome. In light of the interactions
                  between
	the sympathetic adrenergic system and the immune system, the
                  open-hidden
	difference in autonomic responses might be relevant to the

  abstract = {Time perception is affected by the pharmacological
                  action of many
	drugs, but the contribution of expected effects of drugs has
                  not
	been considered. A new design, the extended balanced placebo
                  design
	(EBPD), is presented to study both the pharmacological and
                  expected
	effects of alcohol on time perception. The EBPD makes it
                  possible
	to examine the effects of alcohol across a broad range of
                  expected
	and pharmacological doses. By contrast, the domain of inquiry
                  was
	limited to low doses of alcohol in the original balanced
                  placebo
	design. The design was later modified to study higher doses,
                  but
	the control and the pure drug and expectancy conditions were
                  sacrificed
	in the transformation. In the EBPD, however, any realistic
                  combination
	of the expected and actual dose of alcohol can be studied,
                  while
	retaining pure drug and expectancy conditions. The EBPD was
                  tested
	in the present study with respect to its psychopharmacological
                  effectiveness
	and the effects of alcohol on time perception. The design was
                  effective
	in terms of three manipulation checks: blood alcohol
                  concentration,
	subjective intoxication and postexperimental beliefs about the
                  alcohol
	content of the beverage consumed. In addition, the expected
                  and actual
	doses of alcohol interacted over time to evidence active
                  compensation
	for the pharmacological effects of alcohol on time
                  perception. Finally,
	a covariance structure model was confirmed in which the
                  expected
	and actual doses of alcohol increased the perceived rate of
                  time
	passage, which in turn lengthened objective estimation of a

  abstract = {Abstract:Patientsâ€™ trust in their
                  physicians improves
	their health outcomes because of better compliance, more
                  disclosure,
	stronger placebo effect, and more physicians
                  trustworthy behaviors.
	Patients autonomy may also impact on health
                  outcomes and is increasingly
	being emphasized in health care. However despite the critical
                  role
	of trust and autonomy, patients that naively trust
                  their physicians
	may become overly dependent and lack the motivation to
                  participate
	in medical care. In this article, we argue that increased
                  trust does
	not necessarily imply decreased autonomy. Furthermore,
                  patients with
	high levels of trust and autonomy preferences are most likely

	simultaneous trust and autonomy preferences and for
                  recognizing their
	interactive effects on health outcomes in the dynamic medical
                  encounter.
	This framework argues that policy makers and health care
                  providers
	should make efforts to foster not only patients trust but also
	their preferences for autonomy and thus gain the best position
                  for

                  clinical
	trials? A power-analytic perspective},
  journal = {Clin Ther},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is ongoing debate regarding the ethics
                  of placebo-controlled
	clinical trials when a moderately effective standard treatment
                  exists.
	One aspect of the debate--the number of nonresponders--tends
                  to be
	overlooked. A larger between-group effect size is expected in
                  placebo-controlled
	trials than in trials with an active comparator. For that
                  reason,
	substantially fewer subjects need to be enrolled in
                  placebo-controlled
	trials; consequently, there tend to be far fewer nonresponders
                  in
	placebo-controlled trials. OBJECTIVE: This analysis was
                  undertaken
	to illustrate that the use of placebo as a control can reduce
                  the
	number of subjects who are unnecessarily exposed to delayed
                  treatment.
	METHODS: Statistical power analyses were used to estimate the
                  sample
	size required to detect various population treatment
                  differences
	and the resulting number of nonresponders for 2-tailed
                  chi-square
	tests. RESULTS: Empiric evidence of the phenomenon is provided
                  for
	a wide range of rates of response to placebo, investigational,
                  and
	comparator treatments. For example, 24 subjects (ie, 12 per
                  group)
	are needed to detect differences between placebo (10% response
                  rate)
	and an investigational drug (70% response); 15 of these would
                  not
	respond. In contrast, if the investigational drug (70%
                  response)
	is initially compared with a standard therapy (60% response),
                  752
	subjects would be required, 263 of whom would not
                  respond. CONCLUSIONS:
	This paper shows empirically that placebo controls can reduce
                  the
	number of nonresponders in a randomized controlled trial. The
                  number
	of subjects who are exposed to unproven, albeit promising,
                  investigational
	drugs should be kept to a minimum until placebo-controlled
                  trials

                  development
	of nausea and other adverse conditions has existed for
                  decades. The
	purpose of this study was to examine the effects of
                  manipulating
	expectations through the administration of placebos and
                  nocebos on
	nausea and gastric tachyarrhythmia. Three independent groups
                  of participants
	received identical placebo pills before exposure to a motion
                  sickness
	stimulus but were led to believe the pills contained different
                  pharmacological
	agents. One group received pills described as being effective
                  for
	the prevention of nausea and motion sickness. Another received
                  pills
	described as having the potential to facilitate the
                  development of
	nausea and motion sickness. A control group was not deceived
                  as to
	the nature of the pills they were taking. It was hypothesized
                  that
	relative to the control group, a traditional placebo effect
                  would
	be demonstrated by the first group, and a traditional nocebo
                  effect
	would be exhibited by the second group. This pattern of group
                  differences
	was hypothesized to be evidenced by subjective evaluations of
                  the
	severity of nausea and motion sickness symptoms and by
                  differences
	in gastric tachyarrhythmia, the abnormal stomach activity that
                  consistently
	accompanies nausea and is assessed through electrogastrography
                  (EGG).
	Conclusions: Inducing negative expectations through nocebo
                  administration
	reduced nausea and gastric dysrhythmia during exposure to
                  provocative
	motion, whereas positive placebos were ineffective for
                  preventing
	symptom development. That manipulation of expectation affected
                  gastric
	physiological responses as well as reports of symptoms,
                  suggests
	an unspecified psychophysiological mechanism was responsible
                  for

                  that patients

                  obstetrical patients
	under three different conditions of pain: labor pain,
                  postpartum
	pain and experimental, ischemic muscle pain. Control subjects
                  were
	used to evaluate the natural course and spontaneous,
                  non-placebo
	changes in pain. Pain relief or increase was scored on an
                  equal interval
	scale from subjective estimations made by the subjects at
                  different
	times after administration of the placebo. Placebo reactors
                  were
	arbitrarily defined as individuals showing a response to a
                  placebo
	greater than one standard deviation above the mean pain relief
                  observed
	in the control group. Statistical analysis revealed that the
                  number
	of consistent placebo reactors was not greater than would be
                  expected
	by chance. The obstetrical patients responded to each placebo
                  situation
	independently and showed no statistically significant tendency
                  to
	respond in a consistent way to all three situations. This
                  conclusion
	is not dependent upon the arbitrary definition of placebo
                  reactor
	as shown by other statistical tests. Although fundamental and
                  enduring
	personality characteristics will effect an individual's
                  responsiveness
	to a placebo or a drug, this study places doubt on the belief
                  that
	such traits are sufficiently influential to produce placebo
                  responses
	consistently under different situations. Since general and
                  consistent
	placebo reactivity was not shown in the current study, basic
                  personality
	characteristics probably are not prepotent in determining an
                  individual's
	response to placebos. Predispositions which are ephemeral and
                  which
	interact with specific therapeutic situations are more likely
                  to
	be influential in determining a placebo response.},

  number = {8},
  abstract = {Any change in a patient's signs or symptoms which is the
                  result of
	the therapeutic intent, and not the specific physico-chemical
                  nature,
	of a medical procedure can be called a placebo effect. The
                  history
	of the placebo effect extends from the pre-Christian era when
                  Egyptian
	doctors found their patients improved after giving them
                  lizard's
	blood to drink to the present day finding of relief of pain
                  and anxiety
	after sugar pills or saline injections. Although several
                  investigations
	have shown that certain people react to placebos repeatedly
                  under
	the same laboratory or clinical situation, no study has been
                  made
	to test for consistent reactions under different experimental
                  situations.
	Thus the question of whether or not placebo reactivity is
                  bound to
	definable therapeutic situations has not been answered. In
                  this paper,
	the placebo phenomenon is conceived as being a resultant of
                  four
	major groups of factors: (1) the observable doctor-patient
                  therapeutic
	situation which includes the attitudes and behavior of the
                  doctor,
	the physical environment (hospital versus home), and the type
                  of
	treatment, (2) the predispositions of the patient such as
                  attitudes
	toward doctors and medicines, self-esteem and need for social
                  approval,
	authoritarian and dependency tendencies, and anticipatory
                  ability,
	(3) the patient's [`]internal mediating processes' of
                  attention,
	comprehension, evaluation, and acceptance which interact with
                  the
	therapeutic stimuli and the predispositions to produce (4),
                  the observed
	placebo effect. Future research should aim at better
                  understanding
	of the etiology and dynamics of the placebo effect by
                  controlled
	experimentation involving the above four categories. The many
                  operative
	variables which affect placebo responsiveness must be held
                  constant
	or at least quantitated when assessing the relative importance
                  of
	the one variable under study. Experiments must also eliminate
                  spurious
	placebo effects such as the spontaneous appearance or
                  disappearance
	of signs and symptoms and [`]faking' responses by the patient

  abstract = {This article describes and analyzes decision-making by
                  patients, physicians,
	and drug information providers about registered medical
                  drugs. Based
	on a cognitive psychology perspective, cognitive variables
                  (the individual's
	mediating system) are assumed to be critical factors
                  determining
	both patient and physician behavior. The individual's
                  psychological
	functioning is seen as a continuous reciprocal interaction
                  between
	behavioral, cognitive, and environmental influences; i.e., an
                  interactional
	paradigm is applied. The importance of research models
                  including
	cognitive and situation variables to guide the search for
                  appropriate
	research methods is stressed. An intensive research strategy
                  with
	a small sample of respondents will often be necessary. Also,
                  respondents
	should be asked to describe their reactions to specific
                  medical situations.
	The drug information sender has to select a set of goals for
                  disseminating
	information to patients. Among the goals most often selected
                  are:
	message comprehension, receiver satisfaction, changes in
                  knowledge,
	attitudes, and drug behavior, as well as health effects. More
                  research
	is needed on how the patient's mediating system, the actual
                  situation,
	and the perceived situation steer his search for the use of
                  new drug
	information. A different set of factors influence the
                  patient's decision
	to start a medicinal or drug treatment than the factors that
                  influence
	his decision to continue a treatment. The latter factors
                  include
	forgetfulness, misunderstandings, and the patient's
                  interpretation
	of physiological signs. More cognitive-oriented research about
                  drug
	compliance must be undertaken. In such studies the mediating
                  systems
	of a group of patients could be considered before and after
                  intervention.
	There are a great number of types of inappropriate
                  (irrational) prescribing.
	However, a physician may prescribe rationally in one area but
                  irrationally
	in another. Face-to-face education of physicians has been
                  shown to
	be effective in reducing inappropriate prescribing in a number
                  of
	studies. "Overprescribing" of benzodiazepine has been an issue
                  of
	intensive professional debate during the last decades. The two
                  groups
	who criticize and defend the existing use of benzodiazepines
                  build
	their views on different assumptions about the interaction
                  between
	mind and brain as well as making different value assumptions
                  regarding
	the use of a psychotropic drug. There is a need for
                  prescription
	studies where a cognitive and interactional perspective is
                  combined
	with an information-processing and a normative
                  perspective. The benzodiazepines
	dependency problem has provoked lively discussion among
                  professionals
	and the general public. Long-term benzodiazepine use and
                  personality
	disorders increase the risk of the patient becoming
                  dependent. A
	great number of research models have been suggested for the
                  analysis
	of prescription drug dependency and as guides to the treatment
                  of
	dependency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

                  in

	(i.e. sham) acupuncture (superficial needling of
                  non-acupuncture
	points) over an 8 week period. Patients were asked at baseline
                  whether
	they considered acupuncture to be an effective therapy in
                  general
	and what they personally expected from the treatment. After
                  three
	acupuncture sessions patients were asked how confident they
                  were
	that they would benefit from the treatment strategy they were
                  receiving.
	Patients were classified as responders if the respective main
                  outcome
	measure improved by at least fifty percent. Both univariate
                  and multivariate

                  condition, intervention
	group, age, sex, duration of complaints, etc.) consistently
                  showed
	a significant influence of attitudes and expectations on
                  outcome.
	After completion of treatment, the odds ratio for response
                  between
	patients considering acupuncture an effective or highly
                  effective
	therapy and patients who were more sceptical was 1.67 (95%

                  after

                  important

	(beliefs of the form "This treatment is going to cure me"),

  abstract = {AbstractBackground:Although several forms of effective
                  therapy exist
	for outpatients suffering from major depressive disorder, many
                  patients
	do not profit from treatment. Combining psychotherapy and
                  medication
	may be an effective strategy. However, earlier studies have
                  rarely
	found a clear advantage for the combination. Where an
                  advantage was
	found, a possible placebo effect of adding 2 types of
                  treatment could
	not be ruled out as cause for the superior effect of the
                  combination.
	Methods:A total of 353 patients were screened, of whom 193
                  were randomized
	over 4 conditions: nefazodone plus clinical management,
                  interpersonal
	psychotherapy (IPT), the combination of the two or the
                  combination
	of IPT and pill-placebo. All patients suffered from major
                  depressive
	disorder and had a score of at least 14 on the 17-item
                  Hamilton Rating
	Scale (HAMD). The patients were treated for
                  12Ã¢â‚¬â€œ16 weeks. At
	baseline, at 6 weeks and on completion of treatment, ratings
                  were
	performed by independent raters. The primary outcome measure
                  was
	the HAMD, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale
                  (MADRS)
	the secondary outcome measure. Results:Of the 193 patients
                  included,
	138 completed the trial. All treatments were effective. Using
                  a random
	regression model, no differences between treatments were found
                  on
	the HAMD. On the MADRS, however, the combination of medication
                  with
	psychotherapy was more effective in reducing depressive
                  symptoms
	compared to medication alone, but not to psychotherapy alone
                  or IPT
	with pill-placebo. Conclusions:The results of this study yield
                  support
	for the use of combining medication with psychotherapy instead
                  of
	using medication only in the treatment of depressed
                  outpatients.
	Combination treatment does not have an advantage over
                  psychotherapy
	alone in the present study.Copyright Ã‚Â© 2007

  abstract = {Although high-frequency low-intensity transcutaneous
                  electric nerve
	stimulation (TENS) has been extensively used to relieve low
                  back
	pain, experimental studies of its effectiveness have yielded
                  contradictory
	findings mainly due to methodological problems in pain
                  evaluation
	and placebo control. In the present study, separate visual
                  analog
	scales (VAS) were used to measure the sensory-discriminative
                  and
	motivational-affective components of low back pain. Forty-two
                  subjects
	were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: TENS, placebo-TENS,
                  and
	no treatment (control). In order to measure the short-term
                  effect
	of TENS, VAS pain ratings were taken before and after each
                  treatment
	session. Also, to measure long-term effects, patients rated
                  their
	pain at home every 2 h throughout a 3-day period before and 1
                  week,
	3 months and 6 months after the treatment sessions. In
                  comparing
	the pain evaluations made immediately before and after each
                  treatment
	session, TENS and placebo-TENS significantly reduced both the
                  intensity
	and unpleasantness of chronic low back pain. TENS was
                  significantly
	more efficient than placebo-TENS in reducing pain intensity
                  but not
	pain unpleasantness. TENS also produced a significant additive
                  effect
	over repetitive treatment sessions for pain intensity and
                  relative
	pain unpleasantness. This additive effect was not found for
                  placebo-TENS.
	When evaluated at home, pain intensity was significantly
                  reduced
	more by TENS than placebo-TENS 1 week after the end of
                  treatment,
	but not 3 months and 6 months later. At home evaluation of
                  pain unpleasantness
	in the TENS group was never different from the placebo-TENS
                  group.
	These results suggest that TENS reduces both the
                  sensory-discriminative
	and motivational-af-fective components of low back pain in the
                  short
	term but that much of the reduction in the affective component
                  may
	be a placebo effect. We conclude that TENS should be used as a
                  short-term
	analgesic procedure in a multidisciplinary program for low
                  back pain
	rather than as an exclusive or long-term treatment.},

  abstract = {Throughout its over 200-year history, homeopathy has
                  been proven effective
	in treating diseases for which conventional medicine has
                  little to
	offer. However, given its low cost, homeopathy has always
                  represented
	a serious challenge and a constant threat to the profits of
                  drug
	companies. Moreover, since drug companies represent the most
                  relevant
	source of funding for biomedical research worldwide, they are
                  in
	a privileged position to finance detractive campaigns against
                  homeopathy
	by manipulating the media as well as academic institutions and
                  the
	medical establishment. The basic argument against homeopathy
                  is that
	in some controlled clinical trials (CCTs), comparison with
                  conventional
	treatments shows that its effects are not superior to those of
                  placebo.
	Against this thesis we argue that a) CCT methodology cannot be
                  applied
	to homeopathy, b) misconduct and fraud are common in CCTs, c)
                  adverse
	drug reactions and side effects show that CCT methodology is
                  deeply
	flawed, d) an accurate testing of homeopathic remedies
                  requires more
	sophisticated techniques, e) the placebo effect is no more
                  "plausible"
	than homeopathy, and its real nature is still unexplained, and
                  f)
	the placebo effect is nevertheless a "cure" and, as such,
                  worthy
	of further investigation and analysis. It is concluded that no
                  arguments
	presently exist against homeopathy and that the recurrent
                  campaigns
	against it represent the specific interests of the
                  pharmaceutical
	industry which, in this way, strives to protect its profits
                  from
	the "threat" of a safer, more effective, and much less

                  identified
	for the pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder
                  (OCD). Recent
	factor analytic studies have identified meaningful symptom
                  dimensions
	that may be related to response to serotonin reuptake
                  inhibitors
	and other treatments. Method: A total of 354 outpatients with
                  primary
	OCD were administered the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive
                  Scale Symptom
	Checklist, and its 13 main symptom categories were factor
                  analyzed
	by using principal components analysis. The identified symptom
                  dimensions
	were then entered into multiple regression models as outcome
                  predictors
	of response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors and placebo
                  response
	in a group of 150 nondepressed subjects who completed six
                  double-blind,
	placebo-controlled trials with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor
                  (clomipramine,
	fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and
                  paroxetine). Eighty-four
	patients received a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 66,
                  placebo.
	Results: The principal components analysis identified five
                  factors
	that explained 65.5% of variance in outcome:
                  symmetry/ordering, hoarding,
	contamination/cleaning, aggressive/checking, and
                  sexual/religious
	obsessions. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors were significantly
                  superior
	to placebo on all outcome measures. Initial severity of OCD
                  was related
	to greater posttreatment severity of OCD. Higher scores on the
                  hoarding
	dimension predicted poorer outcome following treatment with
                  serotonin
	reuptake inhibitors, after control for baseline severity. No
                  predictors
	of placebo response were identified. Exclusion of clomipramine
                  did
	not modify the overall results, suggesting a cross-serotonin
                  reuptake
	inhibitor effect. Conclusions: The identified symptom
                  dimensions
	are largely congruent with those identified in earlier
                  reports. Patients
	with OCD vary in their response to treatment with serotonin
                  reuptake
	inhibitors. The presence of hoarding obsessions and
                  compulsions is
	associated with poorer response to serotonin reuptake
                  inhibitors.},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {Pain is an essential sensory modality, signaling injury
                  or threat
	of injury. Pain perception depends on both biological and
                  psychological
	factors. However, it is not known whether psychological
                  factors modify
	spinal mechanisms or if its effect is limited to cortical
                  processing.
	Here, we use a placebo analgesic model to show that
                  psychological
	factors affect human spinal nociceptive processes. Mechanical
                  hyperalgesia
	(hypersensitivity) after an injury is attributable to
                  sensitized
	sensory neurons in the spinal cord. After a 5 min, 46 degrees
                  C heating
	of the skin, subjects developed areas of mechanical
                  hyperalgesia.
	This area was smaller in a placebo condition compared with a
                  baseline
	condition. This result suggests that placebo analgesia affects
                  the
	spinal cord as well as supra-spinal pain mechanisms in humans
                  and
	provides strong supporting evidence that placebo analgesia is
                  not
	simply altered reporting behavior. Central sensitization is
                  thought
	to mediate the exaggerated pain after innocuous sensory
                  stimulation
	in several clinical pain conditions that follow trauma and
                  nervous-system
	injury. These new data indicate that expectation about pain
                  and analgesia
	is an important component of the cognitive control of central
                  sensitization.},

	in insomnia clinical trials. We examined whether the
                  improvement
	seen with placebo was related to taking pills or other
                  non-specific
	factors. METHOD: 95 insomniacs took either a placebo pill
                  (pill+)
	or no pill (pill-) on nights of their choosing over 12
                  weeks. RESULTS:
	Pills were consumed on about half of the nights. Consistent
                  improvement
	was seen with reduced reported sleep latency, wakefulness
                  after sleep
	onset, number of awakenings, and total sleep time over the 12
                  weeks
	for both the pill+ and pill condition. A difference between
                  pill+
	and pill- was detected only for total sleep time, and this
                  difference
	favored pill+. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that
                  improvement
	seen during placebo treatment is more related to non-specific

	most improvements attributed to the placebo effect are
                  actually instances
	of statistical regression. First, whereas older clinical
                  trials susceptible
	to regression resulted in a marked improvement in
                  placebo-treated
	patients, in a modern series of clinical trials whose design
                  tended
	to protect against regression, we found no significant
                  improvement
	(median change 0.3 per cent, p greater than 0.05) in
                  placebo-treated
	patients. Secondly, regression can yield sizeable
                  improvements, even
	among biochemical tests. Among a series of 15 biochemical
                  tests,
	theoretical estimates of the improvement due to regression by
                  selection
	of patients as high abnormals (i.e. 3 standard deviations
                  above the
	mean) ranged from 2.5 per cent for serum sodium to 26 per cent
                  for

                  for
	serum phosphorus (median 9.5 per cent). Thus, we urge caution

  journal = {BMC Med},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {5},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent reviews on placebo effects in
                  clinical trials suggest
	that objective changes following placebo treatments may not
                  exist
	or, at least, have been considerably overestimated. However,
                  the
	possibility that yet unidentified subsets of parameters are
                  responsive
	to placebo treatments has not been taken into
                  account. Therefore,
	the aim of the present study is to examine the effects of
                  placebo
	treatments on objectively measured outcome parameters by
                  specifically
	focusing on peripheral disease processes. METHODS: An initial
                  dataset
	was collected from a MEDLINE search for placebo-controlled,
                  randomized
	clinical trials. Trials with stable disease conditions were
                  identified,
	and the effects of placebo treatments on peripheral outcome
                  parameters
	were estimated by the changes from baseline in the placebo
                  groups.
	An explorative data analysis was conducted in order to
                  identify parameter
	classes with differential responsiveness to placebo
                  treatments. A
	subgroup meta-analysis of a second dataset was performed to
                  test
	whether the preliminary classification would also apply to
                  placebo
	effects derived from the comparison of placebo groups with
                  untreated
	control groups. RESULTS: The explorative analysis of outcome
                  parameters
	and strength of placebo effects yielded a classification into
                  responsive
	"physical" versus non-responsive "biochemical" parameters. In
                  total,
	50% of trials measuring physical parameters showed significant
                  placebo
	effects, compared with 6% of trials measuring biochemical
                  parameters.
	A subgroup meta-analysis substantiated the differential
                  response
	(physical parameters: n = 14, Hedges' pooled effect size g =
                  0.34,
	95% CI 0.22 to 0.46; biochemical parameters: n = 15, g = 0.03,
                  95%
	CI -0.04 to 0.10). The subanalysis of the second dataset
                  supported
	the classification and revealed a significant improvement for
                  physical
	parameters (n = 20, g = 0.22, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.36) and a
                  deterioration
	for biochemical parameters (n = 6, g = -0.17, 95% CI -0.31 to
                  -0.02).
	CONCLUSION: The results suggest that placebo interventions can
                  improve
	physical disease processes of peripheral organs more easily
                  and effectively
	than biochemical processes. This differential response offers
                  a good
	starting point for theoretical considerations on possible
                  mediating
	mechanisms, and for future investigations in this field.},

                  stimuli increased
	alertness, contentedness and skin conductance levels, and
                  information
	that the drink contained caffeine decreased calmness in
                  Experiment
	1. However, unexpected information about the caffeine content
                  of
	the drink, and the order of the conditions, could have masked
                  some
	effects of the experimental manipulations. Experiment 2
                  followed
	up this hypothesis. The results showed a conditioned increase
                  in
	startle eyeblink reflexes, and that caffeine-associated
                  stimuli together
	with information that the drink contained caffeine increased
                  contentedness.
	Conclusions: Caffeine-associated stimuli increased arousal,
                  and information
	about the content of the drink modulated arousal in the
                  direction
	indicated by the information. Thus, both the classical
                  conditioning
	and expectancy theories of placebo effects received support,
                  and
	placebo effects were strongest when both conditioned responses
                  and
	expectancy-based responses acted in the same direction.},

  abstract = {As a therapeutic intervention, homeopathy is the target
                  of increased
	scepticism because in the main, its remedies are diluted and
                  succussed
	(potentized) out of material existence. This puts homeopathy
                  seemingly
	at odds with the paradigm of conventional science, in
                  particular,
	that atoms and molecules are the fundamental building blocks
                  of all
	matter. Accordingly, homeopathy cannot work, so that any
                  reported
	beneficial effects must, at best, be due to the placebo
                  effect. The
	purpose of this article is to challenge that conclusion and to
                  suggest
	that there may well be conventional science-based explanations
                  of
	how homeopathy could be possible. Homeopathy's key principles
                  are
	first described. Then the double-blind randomized controlled
                  trial
	(RCT), the chief means by which homeopathic remedies and
                  prescribing
	are tested, is shown to be based on a linear reductionism that
                  is
	too blunt an instrument with which to test the efficacy of
                  complex
	interventions such as homeopathy. The memory of water
                  hypothesis,
	as a mechanism for how potentized remedies might work, is
                  reviewed,
	along with some evidence for its existence. A possible
                  rationale
	for the water memory effect is proposed in terms of a dynamic
                  ordering'
	of water's constantly switching network of intermolecular
                  hydrogen
	bonds, induced by the manufacturing process of homeopathic
                  remedies.
	This could lead to a long-range molecular coherence' between
                  trillions
	of mobile water molecules. However, the water memory effect is
                  an
	essentially pharmacological explanation of homeopathy's
                  putative
	efficacy. It is pointed out that healing also entails an
                  interaction
	between consenting beings. From this point of view, an
                  explanation
	of any therapeutic procedure should include an attempt to
                  describe
	the nature of the patient-practitioner interaction. From this
                  perspective,
	a quantum theoretical treatment of the therapeutic process,
                  involving
	a form of macro-entanglement between patient, practitioner and
                  remedy
	(PPR), is advanced as another possible explanation of the
                  homeopathy's
	efficacy. This shows that the reason double-blind RCTs deliver
                  at
	best only equivocal results on homeopathy's efficacy is
                  because it
	effectively breaks the PPR entangled state. A comparison is
                  made
	between the entanglement-breaking effect of double-blind RCTs
                  and
	the wave-function collapsing' effect of observation in
                  orthodox quantum
	theory. The article concludes by suggesting that the memory of
                  water
	and PPR entanglement are not competing but most likely
                  complementary
	hypotheses, and that both are probably required in order to
                  provide
	a complete description of the homeopathic process. While
                  awaiting
	experimental evidence of these hypotheses, it is suggested
                  that observations
	of clinical outcomes would be superior to RCTs for further
                  testing
	homeopathy's efficacy.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In two recent studies of double-blind
                  placebo-controlled
	homeopathic provings, entanglement was reported to have
                  occurred
	between verum and placebo arms of the trials. This contrasts
                  directly
	with the entanglement-disrupting effects of blinding, recently
                  proposed
	as the reason for the failure of randomized controlled trials
                  (RCTs)
	to demonstrate unequivocally the efficacy of homeopathy. It is
                  proposed
	here that such entanglement between remedy and placebo during
                  these
	double-blind placebo controlled provings is the direct result
                  of
	the blinding process. METHOD: A previously developed
                  theoretical
	model of entanglement in homeopathy among patient,
                  practitioner,
	and remedy (called PPR entanglement) was used in this
                  investigation.
	RESULTS: In agreement with the results from the proving
                  studies,
	the model predicts that application of the double-blind RCT
                  methodology
	to homeopathic provings leads to entanglement between both
                  remedy
	and placebo arms of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: These theoretical
                  findings
	can be understood in terms of the act of blinding leading to
                  loss
	of information because of quantum-like state superposition of
                  the
	verum and placebo proving groups. This is compared to
                  conclusions
	drawn from the well-known double-slit experiment of quantum
                  physics,
	and quantum information processing. It leads to a suggestion
                  for
	testing entanglement in homeopathic provings.},

  abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp; Background: Several studies have
                  shown that response
	expectancies are an important mechanism of popular
                  psychological
	interventions for pain. However, there has been no research on
                  whether
	response expectancies and treatment credibility independently
                  mediate
	hypnotic and cognitive-behavioral pain interventions and
                  whether
	the pattern of mediation is affected by experience with the
                  interventions.
	Also, past research has indicated that hypnotic pain
                  interventions
	may be moderated by hypnotic suggestibility. However, these
                  studies
	have typically failed to measure the full range of
                  suggestibility
	and have assessed pain reduction and suggestibility in the
                  same experimental
	context, possibly inflating the association between these
                  variables.Purpose:
	To clarify the mediator role of response expectancies and
                  treatment
	credibility, and the moderator role of hypnotic suggestibility
                  in
	the hypnotic and cognitive-behavioral reduction of
                  pain.Methods:
	Approximately 300 participants were assessed for
                  suggestibility.
	Then, as part of an apparently unrelated experiment, 124 of
                  these
	individuals received analogue cognitive-behavioral, hypnotic,
                  or
	placebo control pain interventions.Results: Response
                  expectancies
	and credibility independently mediated treatment. The extent
                  of mediation
	increased as participants gained more experience with the
                  interventions.
	Suggestibility moderated treatment and was associated with
                  relief
	only from the hypnotic intervention.Conclusions: Response
                  expectancies
	and treatment credibility are unique mechanisms of hypnotic
                  and cognitive-behavioral
	pain interventions. Hypnotic suggestibility predicts relief
                  from
	hypnotic pain interventions and this association is not simply
                  an
	artifact of measuring suggestibility and pain reduction in the
                  same
	experimental context. The relationship between suggestibility
                  and
	hypnotic pain reduction appears to be linear in nature.},

	drugs. Little of this has reached the European press. An

                  inert substance
	but also receive support, concern, and reassurance that
                  assists the
	therapeutic alliance and encourages the positive attitude that
                  forms
	the basis of cognitive treatment. Response to non-specific
                  factors
	is seen in all fields of medicine but is particularly potent
                  in psychiatry.
	The placebo response is variable across settings and across
                  time
	and is unpredictable. Historical data cannot therefore provide
                  an
	adequate control for treatment effects in studies of new
                  drugs. The
	scientific position is clear that a comparison against placebo
                  is
	required for the unequivocal demonstration of the efficacy of
                  a treatment.
	Evidence from at least two positive well designed and
                  conducted placebo-controlled
	studies is generally accepted as appropriate to establish the
                  efficacy
	of a drug. Attention to diagnosis, severity of illness, and to
                  possible
	comorbid conditions is needed in the design and conduct of
                  placebo-controlled
	studies in order to optimise the chance of obtaining valid
                  data.
	The use of all data obtained, including dropouts due to lack
                  of efficacy,
	should be maximised. The use of placebo may not be possible in
                  some
	conditions that represent medical emergencies or may be
                  difficult
	to justify in serious disorders where an effective treatment
                  has
	already been established. Alternative designs to
                  placebo-controlled
	studies can be considered. Consistent superior efficacy
                  compared
	with a well accepted, effective treatment, given in an easily
                  defended
	dose, is considered to be good evidence of efficacy provided
                  that
	the studies are well designed and well conducted. Evidence of
                  superior
	efficacy to an established effective comparator treatment may
                  be
	regarded as evidence of efficacy. The demonstration of a
                  dose-response
	relationship where one dose is found to be significantly
                  better than
	another, can be taken as evidence for efficacy, particularly
                  where
	there is already placebo-controlled evidence of the efficacy
                  of the
	identified dose. Where a new treatment is found, under
                  controlled
	conditions, to be equivalent to an existing well accepted
                  comparator
	treatment, given at a clearly effective dose, this may be
                  taken as
	evidence of efficacy, but only if the comparator is
                  consistently
	superior to placebo and if equivalence has been defined
                  beforehand.
	The claims for efficacy based on results from equivalence
                  studies
	are less easily sustained than the evidence from
                  placebo-controlled
	studies or studies demonstrating superior efficacy, due to the
                  fact
	that those studies have no internal validation.},

	comorbidity such as alcoholism, personality disorders or brief
                  depression.
	The rising placebo response is associated with an increasing
                  variability
	of placebo response seen in some centres. The ability of some
                  centres
	to select appropriate patients for studies to demonstrate a
                  separation
	of reference treatment and placebo and the inability of other
                  centres
	suggests that a more careful selection of investigators is
                  important.
	Selection should be based on their experience, their record
                  from
	previous studies, and their aptitude for being trained. The
                  inclusion
	of a reference treatment arm provides a useful means to judge
                  the
	performance of individual centres. The exclusion of eccentric
                  centres
	that fail to reach predetermined performance criteria, such as
                  a
	failure to separate reference treatment from placebo, may be
                  considered.
	Trial designs need to qualify adequately the study population
                  and
	pay sufficient attention to diagnosis, minimum severity and
                  comorbidity
	at entry. Greater care is needed in excluding concomitant
                  overt or
	covert psychotherapy and in reducing the unnecessary
                  therapeutic
	contact that has been increased unwittingly by some
                  protocols. Identifying
	patients with prior stability of illness, with clear
                  disability,
	and with a minimum severity at entry is likely to lower the
                  placebo
	response substantially and increase the effect size and power
                  of
	the study. The possible influence of comedication should also
                  be
	considered. The inclusion of a placebo run in period is
                  considered
	unhelpful and the use of better statistical techniques should
                  be
	adopted to maximise the sensitivity of the study and increase
                  the
	chances of testing efficacy.},

	in wrongly concluding that an effect is due to treatment when
                  it
	is due to chance. Ignorance of the problem can lead to errors
                  in
	decision making. RTM occurs whenever a non-random sample is
                  selected
	from a population and 2 imperfectly correlated variables are
                  measured.
	The less correlated the 2 variables, the larger the RTM

	can confound the strategy of using diagnostic tests to target
                  and
	monitor treatment, as the preliminary test has a high
                  probability
	of giving an abnormal result through chance, and initial
                  treatment

	posited the primacy of brain over mind, while it is just as
                  reasonable

                  studying the
	effectiveness of medication often use the [`]double blind'
                  trial.
	Unfortunately, in less than 5% of the studies reported in
                  major medical
	and psychiatric journals was there a check to determine
                  whether patients
	and observers were blind. Between 1972 and 1983 there was
                  increasing
	reliance on active placebos which attempt to mimic the effects
                  of
	the medication. It is unlikely however, that patients are not
                  aware
	of significantly different physiologic changes within them
                  resulting
	from the different chemicals. Whenever a physician informs a
                  subject
	that they may be on placebo or active treatment medication,
                  they
	will spend much time in trying to guess when they are taking
                  which.
	In these situations Philip's paradox will apply. This states
                  that
	the more potent a therapeutic variable the less likely its
                  efficacy
	can be [`]proven' in a double-blind study. One can only
                  [`]prove'
	that medication is no more effective than placebo. To have a
                  truly
	blind procedure, the active placebo must have identical
                  physiological
	effects to those of the medication being studied. We are now
                  using
	the patient's and the observer's awareness of changes as
                  useful information
	to obtain: 1. 1) a guess factor, the percentage of correct
                  guesses
	whether the patient is on medication or placebo;2. 2) a
                  direction
	factor, whether the patient considers the change beneficial or
                  detrimental;3.
	3) an attributional factor, whether the change is considered
                  to result
	from medication or other intervening variables. This
                  information
	is usually reliable and can be analyzed with the usual

	Using the 50% response definition, we found that 45.6% of
                  placebo
	nonresponders were on one antiepileptic drug at baseline,
                  compared

  abstract = {The placebo effect has long been something of a
                  mystery. The response

	as an artefact; or to view it as an important, but unknown,
                  component

                  view
	is supported by the weight of evidence. After describing and
                  evaluating
	a range of evidence relating to the placebo effect, it is
                  concluded
	that placebos are active and potent elements in a complete
                  theory
	of healing. Central to the effect is the interaction of the
                  patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s
	and the clinicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beliefs in

	effects of exercise and the placebo effects associated with

	Every attempt to study exercise arouses placebo factors (e.g.,
                  expectations,
	involvement, subjective utility) that also have an effect on
                  the
	psychological criteria. If the exercise in a placebo group is
                  nominal,
	it does not activate placebo factors. If it offers meaningful
                  activity,

                  is postulated

	Placebo and nocebo mechanisms, not well understood, are likely

	used, help define our profession. The role of the doctor in

                  effective
	placebo response will lead to happy and healthy

                  guidelines,
	tests, algorithms, procedures, and drugs without the human
                  touch.
	Healthcare, rendered by a faceless, uncaring army of protocol
                  aficionados,
	will miss an opportunity to deliver an effective placebo
                  response.

                  who
	received feedback that the noise was having a strong impact on
                  their
	symptoms made fewer speech dysfluencies while reading the
                  speech
	than arousing noise subjects who received feedback that the
                  noise
	was having little impact. Arousing noise subjects in the
                  strong impact
	condition also made fewer speech errors than relaxing noise
                  subjects
	in the strong impact condition. Finally, within the arousing
                  noise
	groups, subjects' perceptions of the impact of the noise on
                  their
	symptoms correlated significantly with their rate of speech
                  errors.
	These findings support the expectancy-attribution model of

                  measure in clinical
	trials the mechanisms underlying placebo effects are still not
                  fully
	understood. We hypothesised that information about the
                  likelihood
	of receiving placebo might influence the perception of adverse
                  effects
	in volunteers participating in a clinical trial. Methods:
                  Healthy
	subjects received either nifedipine 20mg or placebo in an
                  adaptive
	two-stage crossover study. Sixty subjects were randomised to a
                  group
	given either correct (50% chance) or misleading (100% chance)
                  information
	about the likelihood of receiving the active drug. A sum of
                  the severity
	scores from visual analogue scales over all individual adverse
                  effects
	was defined as the primary endpoint. Results: The analysis
                  revealed
	no difference in the primary endpoint between the two
                  groups. This
	lack of difference may in part be attributable to a
                  conditioning
	effect as on the first study day higher symptom scores were
                  reported
	by the participants than on the second study day. Furthermore,
                  the
	day effect seemed to arise mainly when the first day treatment
                  was
	the placebo. For the placebo the day effect was clearly
                  significant
	(p = 0.012), with higher scores on the first day. A further
                  explorative
	finding in patients given placebo was a tendency for higher
                  scores
	in the group with the misleading information (p =
                  0.08). Nothing
	of that sort was found in the analysis for active
                  treatment. The
	day effect collapsed and the factor information did not show
                  any
	tendency of being a potential influence. Conclusions: In the
                  present
	study we did not find a statistically significant effect of
                  misleading
	information on reported adverse events. The large treatment
                  and day
	effects observed made it difficult to detect a potential small
                  information
	effect. However, this study excluded a strong and relevant
                  effect
	of information on the frequency and severity of reported
                  adverse
	events. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Drug Safety is the

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Placebo response is defined as a change in
                  health status
	resulting from the symbolic significance attributed by the
                  patient
	or proxy to the physician encounter. Our goals were to
                  validate the
	PR12 survey as a measure of placebo response and to analyze
                  the placebo
	response as a discrete and measurable component of everyday
                  office
	encounters with the otolaryngologist. STUDY DESIGN: This was a
                  prospective,
	before-and-after clinical outcomes study of 95 children aged 6
                  months
	to 12 years conducted in an academic metropolitan pediatric
                  otolaryngology
	practice. Caregivers completed the PR-12 survey at entry and
                  at least
	4 weeks later. The survey included 3 domains (4 questions
                  each) reflecting
	the main components of the placebo response: meaningful
                  explanation,
	care and concern, and mastery and control. PR-12 was
                  correlated with
	longitudinal change in health status at least 1 to 2 months
                  after
	the baseline visit. Outcome measures included direct and
                  indirect
	measures of change in disease-specific quality of life and
                  satisfaction
	with change. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability was fair for
                  most PR-12
	survey items (R = 0.41 to 0.76) but was higher for domains
                  (0.60
	to 0.66) and the overall survey score (0.66). PR-12 had
                  excellent
	internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.91) and appropriate
                  construct
	validity. Caregiver satisfaction change at follow-up
                  correlated with
	the PR-12 (r = -.25, P = 0.036). Conversely, no correlation
                  was seen
	between the PR-12 and direct and indirect measures of change
                  in disease
	specific quality of life. CONCLUSION: Placebo response is an
                  important
	and potentially measurable aspect of clinical
                  encounters. PR-12 is
	a promising first step at creating a brief, reliable, and
                  valid instrument
	to assess the placebo response. SIGNIFICANCE: Reemphasizing
                  the therapeutic
	potential of the doctor-patient relationship may improve
                  quality
	of care and disease outcomes.},

	practices since their origins (). Recent experimental data
                  indicate
	that we would be well advised to further consider placebo
                  effects
	in future therapeutic strategies, with a better knowledge of
                  their
	potency, psychological basis and underlying neurobiological
                  mechanisms.
	Current research in the areas of pain, depression and
                  ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s
	disease has uncovered some of the potential neurobiological
                  mechanisms
	of placebo effects. These data indicate that conscious
                  expectation
	and unconscious behavioral conditioning processes appear to be
                  the
	major neurobiological mechanisms capable of releasing
                  endogenous
	neurotransmitters and/or neurohormones that mimic the expected
                  or
	conditioned pharmacological effects. To date, research on
                  placebo
	responses affecting immune-related diseases is scarce, but
                  there
	are consistent indications that skin and mucosal inflammatory
                  diseases,
	in particular, are strongly modulated by placebo
                  treatments. However,
	the brainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capability to
                  modulate peripheral immune reactivity
	has been impressively demonstrated by paradigms of behavioral
                  conditioning
	in animal experiments and human studies. Thus, placebo effects
                  can
	benefit end organ functioning and the overall health of the
                  individual
	through positive expectations and behavioral conditioning
                  processes.

	by clinical improvement that is not subsequently followed by a
                  worsening
	of symptoms (sustained clinical response). To date, several
                  reports
	demonstrate that early response rates are equivalent between
                  antidepressant-treated
	and placebo-treated groups of patients with major depressive
                  disorder,
	suggesting that patients who demonstrate significant and
                  sustained
	symptom improvement during the first 2 weeks of treatment are
                  not
	responding to the antidepressant itself, but to nonspecific,
                  placebo-like
	factors. OBJECTIVE: To compare early sustained response rates
                  between
	antidepressant- and placebo-treated adults with major
                  depressive
	disorder. DATA SOURCES: Medline/Pubmed were searched. No year
                  of
	publication limits were used. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized,
                  double-blind,
	placebo-controlled antidepressant trials or pooled
                  reports/meta-analyses
	of such trials reporting early sustained response rates for
                  major
	depressive disorder. The decision to include studies in the
                  meta-analysis
	was performed by 2 reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were
                  extracted
	with the use of a precoded form. DATA SYNTHESIS: Analyses were
                  performed
	on the proportion of patients who achieved a sustained
                  response the
	first 2 weeks of treatment, as well as the first week of
                  treatment.
	A random-effects model with fixed drug effects was used to
                  combine
	the studies and make comparisons of sustained early response
                  rates
	between antidepressant- and placebo-treated groups. Data from
                  8 reports
	involving a total of 7121 major depressive disorder patients
                  (4076
	randomized to treatment with an antidepressant and 3045
                  randomized
	to placebo) were analyzed. Antidepressant-treated patients
                  were more
	likely to demonstrate sustained clinical response by 2 weeks
                  (odds
	ratio 2.06, 95% CI: 1.52-2.8) or 1 week of treatment (odds
                  ratio
	1.50, 95% CI: 1.08-2.08) than placebo-treated
                  patients. CONCLUSIONS:
	The results of the present analysis suggest that "true" drug
                  response
	can occur the first 2 week as well as the first week of
                  treatment
	of major depressive disorder with conventional

	criticized for relying on its modern biomedical tradition to
                  the
	neglect of the psychosocial aspects of health. This neglect
                  may account
	for patients' dissatisfaction and eventual use of alternative
                  health
	approaches. The concept of placebo has sustained dramatic
                  Ã¢â‚¬Å“proteanÃ¢â‚¬?
	metamorphoses through the ages. For centuries, placebos have
                  been
	regarded as powerful deceptive therapies. From the middle of
                  the
	twentieth century, however, conventional medicine has used
                  placebos
	as methodologic tools to distinguish the specific from the
                  nonspecific
	ingredients in treatments. In modern medical research, the
                  double-blind,
	placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial has been
                  established
	as the gold standard for the assessment of any new
                  treatment. Recently
	a new trend regarding placebos seems to have emerged. The

                  ketamine
	(mean dose: 32 mg), alfentanil (mean dose: 3075 mu g), or

	Mean reduction +/-SEM relative to placebo were for ongoing

                  rule
	out a non-specific 'active placebo' response as the cause for
                  reduction

                  study

	In this paper, we developed and applied a novel framework to
                  examine
	the modulation of functional connectivity networks during
                  resting

                  little

	language, RCT with 20 or more IBS patients who were treated
                  for at
	least 2 weeks. This analysis is limited to studies that
                  assessed
	global response (improvement in overall symptoms). The
                  variables
	considered as potential placebo modifiers were study design,
                  study
	duration, use of a run-in phase, Jadad score, entry criteria,
                  number

	placebo-controlled RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The

	ranged from 16.0 to 71.4% with a population-weighted average
                  of 40.2%,
	95% CI (35.9Ã¢â‚¬â€œ44.4). Significant
                  associations with lower placebo

                  entry
	(P = 0.049) and an increased number of office visits (P =
                  0.026).Placebo
	effects in IBS clinical trials measuring a global outcome are
                  highly
	variable. Entry criteria and number of office visits are
                  significant
	predictors of the placebo response. More stringent entry
                  criteria
	and an increased number of office visits appear to
                  independently
	decrease the placebo response. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

                  those variables
	studied as social psychological factors are actually part of
                  the

                  in maintaining
	tobacco smoking behavior, and nonpharmacological factors
                  associated
	with smoking play a key role. Some of these factors may
                  influence
	smoking behavior by eliciting placebo effects, or responses
                  related
	specifically to the belief that one is consuming a
                  drug. Greater
	knowledge of placebo effects of smoking would improve our
                  understanding
	of factors that maintain smoking behavior, thereby aiding
                  efforts
	to develop treatments to counter the influence of these
                  factors.
	In addition, better understanding of placebo effects from
                  other means
	of nicotine intake could help determine mechanisms of the
                  therapeutic
	actions of nicotine replacement therapy, perhaps enhancing its
                  efficacy
	in smoking cessation. Placebo effects of smoking or other
                  nicotine
	intake have received little research attention. In this
                  review, we
	first discuss common terms and methods of placebo research,
                  especially
	the balanced-placebo design. We then examine the limited
                  research
	directly assessing placebo effects of smoking and other
                  nicotine
	intake, namely studies that manipulated instructions to
                  subjects
	about the drug content of an ingested substance. Finally, we
                  examine
	other studies relevant to gauging the likely magnitude of
                  placebo
	smoking effects. In an effort to encourage more research on
                  these
	placebo effects, we pay substantial attention to future
                  directions.
	Among recommendations are testing the utility of the
                  balanced-placebo
	design and other rigorously controlled designs, and including
                  multiple
	measures of placebo effects in addition to self-report. Future
                  research
	also should explore the moderating influences of the

	functional imaging methods, it is now possible to study the
                  underlying
	opioid and placebo processes in the brain. Such studies have

	the interaction between higher cognitive processes and the

                  several features.
	For instance, expectations have a strong influence on the
                  subsequent
	emotional experience of both. Recent imaging data indicate
                  similarities

                  placebo
	analgesia is a special case of reward processing and that
                  placebo
	treatment could modulate emotional perception in the same way

	does pain perception. The behavioral part of this study
                  indicates
	that placebo treatment has an effect on how subjects perceive
                  unpleasant
	pictures. Furthermore, event-related fMRI demonstrated that

	modulatory network, including the rostral anterior cingulate

	the reported placebo effect and were predicted by the amount

                  Trials
	in Chronic Diseases: Explanations and Recommendations" (see

	2003-02291-005). The author acknowledges Blair's important
                  observation
	that the "placebo effect" is compromised in a clinical trial
                  setting,
	a point he tries to raise in his article as the fourth
                  "intrinsic"
	limitation of randomized controlled clinical trials. The
                  author agrees
	with Blair that the placebo effect is invariably compromised
                  in most
	drugs used to treat chronic diseases. At the same time the
                  author
	is puzzled at some of Blair's comments concerning clinical
                  trials.
	In the author's experience with more than 35 clinical trials,
                  the
	placebo is not "demonized," but is rather presented to the
                  patient
	and accepted as a legitimate alternative to the drug. The
                  authors
	and people that he knows who conduct clincal trials would not
                  embark
	on a trial that includes a placebo in which the placebo is
                  inappropriate
	or unethical. The author concludes by stating that he shares
                  some
	of Blair's concerns about limitations of clinical trials, but
                  emphasizes
	that clinical trials nonetheless remain a very powerful method
                  in
	clinical research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all

	bowel syndrome (IBS) clinical trials that correlate with
                  higher levels
	of placebo response. Methods: We performed a systematic review
                  of
	placebo-controlled trials in patients with IBS to assess which
                  variables
	correlate with a higher placebo response. Placebo responses
                  for global
	symptom improvement and for decreased abdominal pain were
                  assessed.
	Univariate and multiple linear regression analyses were
                  conducted.
	Results: Higher rates of global improvement correlated with
                  frequency
	of administration of study intervention (r = .31, P = .03),
                  duration
	of the study (r = .28, P = .04), and overall treatment effect
                  of
	the active agent being studied (r = .33, P = .02). Higher
                  rates of
	decreased abdominal pain correlated with the frequency of
                  intervention
	(r = .39, P = .02) and overall treatment effect (r = .40, P =
                  .01),
	whereas lower placebo response rates correlated with year of
                  the
	study (r = -.36, P = .03), median age (r = -.38, P = .04), and
                  duration
	of study run-in period (r = -.33, P = .04). On multivariate
                  analysis,
	global improvement in the placebo group was associated
                  significantly
	with intervention frequency (P = .0079), overall treatment
                  response
	(P = .0031), and parallel study design (P = .0044). Decreased
                  abdominal

	(P = .0061) and overall treatment response (P =

	In IBS studies, higher placebo response rates correlated with
                  frequency
	of the intervention and with overall treatment effect of the
                  active

                  possible
	to minimize placebo response by less frequent dosing. In

	patients with IBS, it may be possible to harness the placebo

	as to increase physical performance and endurance in healthy
                  subjects.
	Here we investigated the effects of an ergogenic placebo on
                  the performance
	of the quadriceps muscle, which is responsible for the
                  extension
	of the leg relative to the thigh. In a first experiment, a
                  placebo
	was administered along with the suggestion that it was
                  caffeine at
	high dose. This resulted in a significant increase in mean
                  muscle
	work across subjects, which, however, was not accompanied by a
                  decrease
	of perceived muscle fatigue. In a second experiment, the
                  placebo
	caffeine was administered twice in two different
                  sessions. Each time,
	the weight to be lifted with the quadriceps was reduced
                  surreptitiously
	so as to make the subjects believe that the
                  Ã¢â‚¬Ëœergogenic
                  agentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢
	was effective. After this conditioning procedure, the load was
                  restored
	to the original weight, and both muscle work and perceived
                  fatigue
	assessed after placebo administration. Compared with the first
                  experiment,
	the placebo effect was larger, with a significant increase in
                  muscle
	work and decrease in perceived muscle fatigue. Within the
                  context
	of the role of peripheral and/or central mechanisms in muscle
                  performance,
	the present findings suggest a central mechanism of top-down
                  modulation
	of muscle fatigue. In addition, the difference between the
                  first
	and second experiment underscores the role of learning in
                  increasing
	muscle performance with placebos. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

                  mechanisms inducing

	depression. Here, we show that placebo analgesia is
                  accompanied by
	a reduced [beta]-adrenergic activity of the heart. We measured
                  heart
	rate during placebo-induced expectation of analgesia, both in
                  the
	clinical and the laboratory setting. In the clinical setting,
                  we
	found that the placebo analgesic response to an electrical
                  noxious
	stimulus was accompanied by a reduced heart rate response. In
                  order
	to investigate this effect from a pharmacological viewpoint,
                  we reproduced
	the same effect in the laboratory setting by using
                  experimental ischemic
	arm pain. We found that the opioid antagonist naloxone
                  completely
	antagonized both placebo analgesia and the concomitant reduced
                  heart
	rate response, whereas the [beta]-blocker propranolol
                  antagonized
	the placebo heart rate reduction, but not placebo
                  analgesia. By contrast,
	both placebo responses were present during muscarinic blockade
                  with
	atropine, indicating no involvement of the parasympathetic
                  system.
	In order to better understand the effects of naloxone and
                  propranolol,
	we performed a spectral analysis of the heart rate variability
                  for
	the identification of the sympathetic and parasympathetic
                  components,
	and found that the [beta]-adrenergic low frequency
                  (0.15Â Hz) spectral
	component was reduced during placebo analgesia, an effect that
                  was
	reversed by naloxone. These findings indicate that placebo
                  analgesia
	is accompanied by a complex cascade of events which affect the
                  cardiovascular
	system.},

	pharmacotherapy and whether ICC and ISR as predictors reflect
                  specific
	pharmacological actions or a placebo effect. Forty patients
                  with
	major depression were treated with three different
                  antidepressants
	for 4 weeks. Overall clinical change and final subjective
                  response
	were taken as outcome criteria. The patients were randomly
                  assigned
	to two subgroups in a double-blind design. Initially, one
                  group received
	the active drug and the other placebo. Afterwards, all
                  patients were
	given the active drug. Significant correlations were found
                  between
	ICC and ISR and at least one of the outcome criteria in the
                  total
	sample and in each subgroup. The findings show that ICC and
                  ISR may
	be significant predictors of outcome. The predictive value of
                  ICC

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors studied the responses of
                  drug-treated patients
	in an attempt to validate observations about abrupt and
                  gradual improvements
	in patients receiving placebo. Since previous data suggested
                  that
	in the first 2 weeks of antidepressant treatment specific drug
                  effects
	are unlikely, the authors hypothesized that this improvement
                  is a
	placebo effect. Therefore, in the first 2 weeks of
                  antidepressant
	treatment abrupt and gradual improvements should have the
                  characteristics
	of their placebo counterparts. METHOD: The subjects were 263
                  patients
	in controlled antidepressant trials lasting 6 weeks. RESULTS:
                  The
	percentage of abrupt improvements that occurred in the first 2
                  weeks
	was higher than that for gradual improvements. Abrupt
                  improvements
	during the first 2 weeks of drug treatment were also less
                  persistent
	than gradual improvements with drug and no more persistent
                  than improvements
	with placebo during the same period. However, in weeks 3, 4,
                  and
	5, abrupt and gradual improvements with drug were equally
                  persistent
	and both were more persistent than abrupt improvements with
                  placebo.
	CONCLUSIONS: These data support the authors' findings about
                  placebo.
	Abrupt improvements during treatment with both drug and
                  placebo are
	more likely during the first 2 weeks of treatment and are less
                  likely
	to persist than gradual improvements. The fact that
                  persistence of
	abrupt improvements with drug in weeks 1 and 2 appears
                  different
	from that of gradual improvements but appears no different
                  after
	week 3 suggests that the mechanism of action of abrupt
                  improvement
	with drug changes after week 2.},

                  patterns of
	improvement among patients receiving placebo during clinical
                  trials.
	It was hypothesized that patients who improved abruptly would
                  differ
	from patients whose improvement was gradual in that they would
                  tend
	to improve earlier and would tend to have less persistent
                  improvement.
	METHOD: The subjects were 144 patients who met the DSM-III
                  criteria
	for depressive illness and were randomly assigned to placebo
                  medication
	in four double-blind antidepressant drug trials. All studies
                  lasted
	6 weeks. Mood change was rated each week on a 7-point scale; a
                  rating
	of 1 or 2 was considered an indication of
                  improvement. Improvement
	was judged to be abrupt if the first score of 1 or 2 was
                  immediately
	preceded by a score of 4 or worse, and it was classified as
                  gradual
	if the first score of 1 or 2 was preceded by a score of 3 in
                  at least
	1 week. Improvement was considered persistent if a score of 1
                  or
	2 was not followed by a score of 3 or worse in any subsequent
                  week.
	RESULTS: Of the 144 patients, 72 showed clinical improvement
                  during
	at least one weekly visit; 33 improved abruptly and 39
                  improved gradually.
	The abrupt improvements occurred significantly earlier in the
                  trial
	and were less likely to persist than the gradual improvements
                  regardless
	of when they occurred. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that
                  among
	patients receiving placebo abrupt improvements are a form of
                  placebo
	response and gradual responses may be the result of
                  spontaneous remission.
	These preliminary observations require validation.},

  abstract = {Pattern Analysis is a system that attempts to
                  distinguish true drug
	response on antidepressants from placebo response on
                  antidepressants.
	Essentially it states that patients whose response to
                  treatment occurs
	after two weeks and is persistent, that is does not fluctuate
                  once
	the patient is improved, are more likely to have benefitted
                  from
	a true drug effect than a nonspecific or placebo effect. There
                  have
	been four reports reproducing these original findings. The
                  present
	study is an attempt to demonstrate that the prognosis for drug
                  treated
	patients with different response patterns varies during a
                  discontinuation
	study. To test this hypothesis 393 patients who met criteria
                  for
	improvement were entered into a 50 week discontinuation trial
                  during
	which placebo was randomly substituted at 12 weeks, 26 weeks,
                  and
	50 weeks, or not at all. Results. Patients with true drug
                  patterns
	relapsed significantly more frequently if switched to placebo
                  after
	12 or 26 weeks than if they remained on active medication. The
                  prognosis
	of patients with placebo patterns was equivalent if they
                  remained
	on fluoxetine or were switched to placebo. Continued
                  fluoxetine prevented
	relapse significantly more often in patients with true drug
                  patterns
	than placebo patterns or an acute response. Conclusion. These
                  data
	add to the validity of pattern analysis as differentiating
                  true drug
	from nonspecific responses and extends the utility of pattern
                  analysis
	to the continuation maintenance phases of treatment. These
                  data suggest
	some relapse during maintenance treatment with fluoxetine is
                  due
	to loss of placebo effect. The clinical implications will be

                  some
	placebo effects may also involve retrocausal, or
                  time-reversed, influences.
	Design: Slow cortical potentials in the brain were monitored
                  while
	adult volunteers anticipated either a flash of light or no
                  flash,
	selected with equal probability by a noise-based random number

	Data were collected in individual sessions of 100 trials,
                  contributed
	by 13 female and 7 male adult participants. Outcome measures:
                  Ensemble
	median slow cortical potentials 1 second prior to a light
                  flash were
	compared with the same measures prior to no flash. A
                  nonparametric
	randomized permutation technique was used to statistically
                  assess
	the observed difference. Electroencephalographic data were
                  analyzed
	separately by gender. Results: Females' slow cortical
                  potentials
	significantly differentiated before stimulus onset ( z = 2.72,
                  p
	= 0.007, two-tailed); males showed a suggestive effect in the
                  opposite
	direction ( z = Ã¢Ë†â€™1.64, p = 0.10,
                  two-tailed). Examination of
	alternative explanations indicated that the significant effect
                  in
	females was not caused by anticipatory strategies, equipment
                  or environmental
	artifacts, or violation of statistical
                  assumptions. Conclusions:
	This experiment, in accordance with previous studies showing

	a good choice, considering the potential variability in pain
                  and
	baseline brain activity among individual subjets. In order to
                  infer

	In the lead article in this issue of the Journal of Marketing
                  Research,
	Shiv, Cannon, and Ariely report on a series of studies that
                  suggest
	the following: Price can exert a nonconscious influence on
                  expectancies
	about product quality; Such expectancies can have an impact on
                  actual
	product performance; and such expectancies can also be induced
                  through
	nonprice information, such as advertising claims about product
                  quality.
	As I discuss in this commentary, these findings are noteworthy
                  for
	three reasons. First, they are novel, secondly they are
                  provocative,

                  importance
	of reporting "evidence that blinding was successful", it is
                  unclear
	what constitutes appropriate evidence. Among studies reporting

	respect to the proportions correctly identifying their

                  associated
	with potential bias, especially in relation to self-reported

	outcomes. During the Water Evaluation Trial performed in
                  northern

                  sequential

	showed a strong tendency to believe they had been assigned to
                  the
	active intervention; this translated into a statistically
                  significant
	intergroup difference in the correctness of participants'
                  beliefs,
	even at the start of the trial before unblinding had a chance
                  to
	occur. In addition, many participants (31%) changed their
                  belief
	during the trial, suggesting that assessment of belief at a
                  single
	time does not capture unblinding. Sequential measures based on
                  either
	two or all eight questionnaires identified significant
                  group-related
	differences in belief patterns that were not identified by the

	At the beginning, all patients were placed on placebo in a

	design. Patients who were rated as placebo responders with the
                  physician-administered

	indicated that many patients with a positive response to
                  placebo
	had been entered in the trial. In the reanalysis, elimination
                  of

                  report are to
	consider the current status of the use of placebos in pain
                  medicine
	from clinical, ethical, and legal perspectives. The focus of
                  the
	analysis is a particular case in which the deceptive use of
                  placebo
	pain therapy on an adolescent gave rise to professional
                  grievances
	filed by the patient's mother against the physician who
                  ordered and
	several nurses who administered the placebo. The medical board
                  declined
	to take disciplinary action against the physician, and
                  disciplinary
	action by the board of registered nursing against the nurses
                  was
	successfully challenged by two of the charged nurses in an
                  administrative
	review. While there is a growing literature that challenges
                  the need
	for or justification of the deceptive use of placebos, the
                  practice
	continues and, as the case under consideration indicates,
                  retains
	some influential supporters. DESIGN: This is a case report
                  from a
	community hospital. The patient, referred to here as KC, was
                  an adolescent
	with migraine headaches. The substitution of a placebo (saline
                  solution)
	for an opioid analgesic (morphine) was made during KC's
                  treatment.
	RESULTS: The patient's pain subsided sufficiently following
                  the administration
	of a placebo to permit his discharge from the hospital. The
                  subsequent
	discovery by the patient's mother of the deceptive use of a
                  placebo
	prompted her to file charges of professional misconduct
                  against the
	treating physician and three nurses with their respective
                  professional
	licensing boards. The medical board declined to take
                  disciplinary
	action against the physician, and the disciplinary action by
                  the
	board of registered nursing was successfully challenged in a
                  ruling
	by an administrative law judge following a hearing in which
                  expert
	witnesses took conflicting positions on the acceptability of
                  the
	deceptive use of a placebo. CONCLUSION: While there is a
                  developing
	literature that challenges the ethical legitimacy of the
                  deceptive
	use of placebos in pain medicine, that literature has yet to
                  be recognized
	as unqualifiedly setting the standard of care or of

                  of
	nociception reflected by the opioid sensitive nociceptive
                  R-III reflex.
	Placebo consisted of strong suggestions of pain relief and an
                  intravenous
	injection of saline. Forty minutes after placebo, either the
                  opioid
	antagonist naloxone or saline was administered intravenously
                  without
	subjects noticing (hidden). Sixty healthy males, aged 18-30
                  years,
	voluntarily participated in this study. Subjects were
                  randomized
	into one of four groups: group 1 received placebo and hidden
                  naloxone,
	group 2 received hidden naloxone only, group 3 received
                  placebo and
	hidden saline and group 4 received hidden saline only. Pain
                  was induced
	by electrical stimulation of the sural nerve and evaluated
                  with a
	visual analogue scale (VAS). In addition, changes in the
                  magnitude
	of the nociceptive R-III reflex activity were assessed. We
                  determined
	to what extent R-III reflex activity and subjective pain
                  reports
	were decreased by placebo and we investigated whether these
                  placebo-induced
	changes in reflex activity and subjective pain reports were
                  naloxone
	reversible. Furthermore, we measured the degree of association
                  between
	pain relief as measured on VAS and changes in R-III reflex
                  activity.
	Finally, the role of beta-endorphin was assessed by measuring
                  plasma
	endorphin levels before and after the administration of
                  placebo.
	This study could not demonstrate a placebo effect as measured
                  on
	VAS and R-III responses. The administration of placebo did not
                  appear
	to have an effect on the release of
                  beta-endorphins. Consistently,

                  subgroup

	the VAS did not support the supposition that beta-endorphin is

                  stimuli

                  the effect
	of both electro-acupuncture and placebo-acupuncture on rectal
                  distensibility,
	perception, and spatial summation.METHODS: A tube with two
                  barostat
	balloons was placed in the rectum of 12 healthy subjects and
                  nine
	irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients with rectal
                  symptoms. Volume-controlled
	stepwise distension of the distal balloon only or both
                  balloons was
	performed first as a control, and thereafter with simultaneous
                  placebo-
	or electro-acupuncture in dermatomes S3 and S4. A symptom
                  questionnaire
	and anatomic questionnaire was completed during each
                  distension.RESULTS:
	Rectal elastance increased from 42.0Ã‚Â± 19.6 log
                  mmHg/ml during
	one-balloon distension to 59.6Ã‚Â± 33.1 log
                  mmHg/ml during two-balloon
	distension (p<0.05) in healthy subjects, and from
                  48.8Ã‚Â± 14.4 log
	mmHg/ml (one balloon) to 77.6Ã‚Â± 24.2 log mmHg/ml
                  (p<0.001) in patients
	with IBS. Electro-acupuncture had no effect on rectal
                  sensation,
	elastance, and cutaneous referral when compared to
                  placebo-acupuncture.
	However, acupuncture (both electro- and placebo-) increased
                  volume
	thresholds for sensation compared to control experiments,
                  while objective
	parameters like rectal tone and elastance were
                  unaltered.CONCLUSION:
	Acupuncture has a placebo effect on rectal perception but has
                  no
	effect on rectal distensibility and visceral referral. Spatial
                  summation
	affected both rectum distensibility and perception, but was
                  also
	not altered by acupuncture.(Am J Gastroenterol 2004;99:1-8)

	crossover trial to assess the antitussive effect of
                  dextromethorphan.
	Baseline cough responses were established on two occasions in
                  22
	healthy subjects. They received 60 ml placebo antitussive
                  syrup and
	cough frequency following five inhalations of 10% citric acid
                  over
	5 min was measured at regular intervals up to 12
                  h. Response-time
	models of varying complexity were used to describe the placebo
                  cough
	suppression data. The cough response to placebo was also
                  compared
	to that of the untreated state. The placebo cough response was
                  best
	characterized by a non-linear increase in cough suppression up
                  to
	a maximum reduction of 1.6 coughs from baseline at 4-4.5 h,
                  followed
	by a non-linear return to baseline. The cough response in the
                  untreated
	state was not different from that of placebo (P=0.99). Females
                  coughed
	more frequently than males (median number of COUGHS=10.5
                  vs. 9.0,
	respectively P<0.001; Mann-Whitney U test), and adaptation to
                  the
	cough stimulus was significantly more rapid in females
                  (P<0.025).
	Accordingly, in trials that use citric acid-induced cough,
                  gender
	should be considered in study design, particularly in relation
                  to
	the timing of measurements.},

	on the heightening of positive expectancy by media attention
                  and
	by the sensory experiences associated with intravenous
                  injections.
	Comparisons are drawn with research involving other novel
                  treatments
	and other clinical populations of children with developmental
                  disabilities
	and neurobehavioral disorders. Research regarding mechanisms

	effects is reviewed, including patient and clinician
                  attributes,
	expectancy effects, participation effects, changes in
                  caregiver behavior,
	and conditioning. New evidence regarding the biological basis
                  of
	placebo effects is briefly presented. Since placebo effects
                  are ubiquitous

                  critical
	in designing clinical trials and in evaluating other outcomes
                  research.
	Measurement issues important for research in developmental
                  disabilities
	are emphasized. Ethical concerns have been raised regarding
                  the use
	of placebo in clinical research, but current analysis suggests
                  that
	placebo controls are necessary and defensible on ethical

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the
                  efficacy
	and acceptability of an open-label conditioned placebo dose
                  reduction
	(CPDR) treatment in 70 children with attention deficit
                  hyperactivity
	disorder (ADHD). This paper focuses on the qualitative data
                  from
	the study. METHODS: Following a double-blind, crossover dose
                  finding
	procedure to determine each subject's optimal dose of
                  stimulant medication,
	subjects were randomized to the CPDR treatment or one of two
                  control
	groups. Outcome measures included parent and teacher ratings
                  of ADHD
	behaviours and stimulant side effects. Qualitative assessments
                  were
	based on open-ended interviews of children and
                  parents. Positive
	responders to CPDR and controls were followed for 3 months to
                  assess
	persistence of treatment benefits. RESULTS: Children
                  randomized to
	CPDR showed an excellent treatment response, well maintained
                  over
	time. Parents and children were generally accepting of the
                  treatment.
	Most parents reported treatment benefits and 80% of the
                  children
	found the placebo to be useful. Full disclosure of the placebo
                  to
	parents and children did not appear to negate the placebo's
                  effectiveness.
	Participation effects and changes in caregiver behaviour may
                  have
	contributed to positive treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:
                  Open-label
	use of placebos as part of CPDR treatment may represent an
                  innovative,
	ethical way of harnessing the power of placebos in clinical

                  low-level
	neurotic symptom profile of the disease. In order to assess
                  the placebo
	effect in a dysthymic sample, 78 outpatients (age: 44.74 Â±
                  11.9,
	F/M: 2.4) were selected according to DSM-IV criteria and
                  evaluated
	by means of the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale
                  (MADRS),
	the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Anxiety
                  Rating
	Scale (HARS). During a period of 7 days they were administered
                  placebo
	by oral route and thereafter re-evaluated on the same rating
                  instruments.
	The T0-T7 comparison for both total and single item score was
                  performed
	by ANOVA and multiple comparison techniques. The analysis of
                  data
	showed a significant T0-T7 decrease of the total score of the
                  scales.
	The improvement on the two depression scales resulted to be
                  greater
	with respect to the anxiety scale. The present results tend to
                  confirm

	placebo and hence to the reassuring and empathetic aspects of

                  patients with
	irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) during acupuncture (AC)
                  treatment
	seems to be due to a placebo effect. The aim was to explore if
                  acupuncture
	has some specific influence on the neuroendocrinic and
                  autonomic
	nervous system (ANS).Design/setting Patients with IBS were
                  randomly
	assigned to receive either acupuncture (AC) or sham
                  acupuncture (SAC)
	using the so-called "Streitberger needle". QoL was measured
                  with
	the functional quality of life diseases quality of life
                  questionnaire
	(FDDQL) and SF-36. The effect on ANS was evaluated by
                  measuring salivary
	cortisol and by cardiovascular responses on a tilt table
                  before and
	after 10 AC treatments. Complete data sets of tilt table and
                  salivary
	morning cortisol were available for 9 patients in the AC and
                  12 in
	SAC group.Results QoL increased in both groups
                  (pÂ =Â 0.001) with
	no group differences. Salivary cortisol decreased in all
                  groups (FÂ =Â 10.55;
	pÂ =Â 0.006). However, the decrease was more
                  pronounced in the AC
	group (FÂ =Â 4.07; pÂ =Â 0.033) (ANOVA
                  repeated measures model).
	Heart rate response decreased during orthostatic stress in the
                  AC
	group while it increased in the SAC group
                  (FÂ =Â 9.234; pÂ =Â 0.005),
	indicating an increased parasympathetic tone in the AC
                  group. Improvement
	of pain was positively associated with increased
                  parasympathetic
	tone in the AC group (FÂ =Â 10.1;
                  pÂ =Â 0.006), but not in the SAC
	group.Conclusions The acupuncture specific physiological
                  effects
	are in contrast to the unspecific improvement of QoL in both
                  AC and
	SAC groups. Thus, different mechanisms seem to be involved in
                  placebo
	and real-acupuncture driven improvements. The specific
                  mechanism
	of action of acupuncture on the ANS remains unclear and
                  deserves
	further evaluation.},

	of changes in arousal (blood pressure, heart rate), subjective
                  well-being,
	and reaction time (RT). In Experiment 1 (N = 45),
                  decaffeinated coffee
	was administered, and expectations were produced in one group
                  by
	making them believe they had ingested caffeinated coffee. In
                  Experiment
	2 (N = 45), caffeinated orange juice was given in both
                  experimental
	groups, but only one was informed about the true content. In
                  Experiment
	1, a significant effect for subjective alertness was found in
                  the
	placebo treatment compared to the control group. However, for
                  RT
	and well-being no significant effects were found. In
                  Experiment 2,
	no significant expectancy effects were found. Caffeine
                  produced large
	effects for blood pressure in both treatments compared to the
                  control
	group, but the effects were larger for the false information
                  group.
	For subjective well-being (alertness, calmness), considerable
                  but
	nonsignificant changes were found for correctly informed
                  participants,
	indicating possible additivity of pharmacologic effect and
                  expectations.
	The results tentatively indicate that placebo and expectancy
                  effects
	primarily show through introspection. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is a commonly held belief among health
                  care providers
	that patients respond better to parenteral nonsteroidal
                  anti-inflammatory
	drugs (NSAIDs) than to oral forms by virtue of the patients'
                  belief
	that getting an injection means they are receiving "stronger"
                  medicine.
	To the authors' knowledge, this effect has never been
                  adequately
	documented in the literature. The objective of this study was
                  to
	compare the effects of a placebo analgesic injection vs
                  placebo oral
	analgesia on patients with acute musculoskeletal
                  pain. METHODS: A
	convenience sample of emergency department (ED) patients with
                  acute
	musculoskeletal pain secondary to trauma were
                  enrolled. Patients
	received 225 mL of orange-flavored drink containing 800 mg of
                  ibuprofen.
	Patients then received either a physiologically inactive
                  starch tablet
	resembling ibuprofen 800 mg in taste and appearance or a
                  physiologically
	inactive saline intramuscular (IM) injection resembling
                  ketorolac
	60 mg. Both patients and research nurses were blinded to the
                  addition
	of ibuprofen to the drink and the inactive nature of
                  subsequent medication.
	Pain was evaluated at time 0 and at 30, 60, 90, and 120
                  minutes on
	a 10-mm visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: Sixty-four
                  patients completed
	the study protocol. The VAS scores between groups did not
                  differ
	significantly at baseline or at each subsequent interval (p =
                  0.86).
	CONCLUSIONS: These results contradict the belief that
                  parenteral
	medications confer a selective placebo effect stemming from
                  patients'
	beliefs regarding route of administration and
                  efficacy. Therefore,
	the routine use of IM administration of NSAIDs for suspected
                  enhanced
	analgesia appears unwarranted.},

	groups and treated for 3 weeks with placebo, phenobarbital or
                  diazepam,
	were examined once a week in 3 different states of activation,
                  varying
	from relaxation to moderate and high demand
                  attention. Frequency-analyzed
	EEG recording, pulse rate, drug plasma levels, mood and
                  performance
	were evaluated. The aim of this paper was to find an
                  explanation
	in the EEG for responding correctly or in a non-adequate way
                  to stimuli.
	Based on the activation theory of vigilant behaviour, the EEG
                  recordings
	of the first examination were analyzed before, during and
                  after the
	presentation of specific stimuli and related to 4 types of
                  responses
	(hit, miss, false response, correct rejection) to ascertain
                  whether
	prestimulus patterns were connected with different types of
                  behavioural
	poststimulus responses. The EEG patterns were found to be
                  dependent
	on the type of drug administered as well as on the complexity
                  of
	the task performed. In all 3 treatment groups, low EEG changes
                  before
	stimulus onset seemed to be the necessary condition for
                  adequate
	behavioural responses. A high variability between time-points
                  seemed
	to indicate a subvigilant state which led to non-adequate
                  responses
	and possibly to internally induced stimuli in the vigilance
                  test
	to overcome this state. In the stress phase, however, the
                  missed
	responses were possibly due to selective attention to the
                  simultaneously
	appearing non-relevant stimuli. The conclusion must be drawn
                  that,
	at least in alcoholic patients in the acute withdrawal phase,
                  the
	EEG prior to and during the stimulus presentation plays a
                  decisive
	role in determining the type of emerging behavioural response:
                  the
	differential high variability of the EEG is response-specific,
                  whereas
	the actual power values depend on the medication given and the
                  task
	performed.},

	Jung, â€œEvery crisis is a spiritual crisis.?
                  Western science,

                  Reductionism,

  abstract = {An attempt was made to develop a self-administered test
                  of placebo
	reactivity that combined the reliability of a test of
                  suggestibility
	with the clinical validity of reaction to the placebo
                  effect. Response
	to the Placebo Test was determined by a patient's response to
                  a placebo
	tablet, which was taken by the patient at home for the
                  ostensible
	purpose of determining which medicine would be most helpful to
                  him.
	The Placebo Test and other information were collected after
                  the patient's
	initial intake evaluation at a psychiatric clinic. A series of
                  independent
	variables were related to the Placebo Test as dependent
                  variables,
	and an attempt was made to predict clinical course for
                  patients in
	psychiatric treatment. Although the Placebo Test had high
                  internal-consistency
	reliability of measurement, it may have had low validity as a
                  test
	of placebo-proneness, as evidenced by the difficulty of
                  selecting
	relevant parameters for measurement of the placebo
                  effect. Depending
	on the method of measurement, 32 to 36 patients had positive
                  reactions,
	36 to 49 had neutral reactions, and 14 to 30 had negative
                  reactions.
	Thirty-eight patients had side effects from the placebo, and
                  15 refused
	to take the test. In general, the results obtained varied with
                  the
	method of scoring the Placebo Test, except for the major
                  finding
	that negative placebo reactors were clearly differentiated
                  from positive
	reactors and nonreactors, who were not significantly different
                  from
	one another. The conclusion, now supported by two studies, is
                  that
	analysis of placebo studies requires that positive reactors
                  not be
	compared to a pooled group of negative reactors and
                  nonreactors.
	In addition, analysis should include patients who refuse to
                  take
	the placebo. The relationship between patient improvement and
                  the
	likability measures is the strongest relationship among
                  variables
	and improvement, and it warrants further study.},

  title = {Study of the placebo effect with a placebo test},
  journal = {Comprehensive Psychiatry},
  year = {1968},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {Summary This paper briefly reviewed several
                  methodological problems
	in studies of the placebo effect. The importance of finding
                  appropriate
	measures of placebo effect was emphasized. This led to an
                  attempt
	to develop a more valid and reliable test of placebo
                  reactivity.
	Use of the placebo test led to the following tentative
                  conclusions:
	Inferences made about placebo effects vary with the method of
                  scoring
	placebo reactions. The placebo effect consists of a group of
                  nonreactors
	to the placebo, and a second group of reactors but without
                  regard
	to positive or negative direction. The reactive group is
                  subdivided
	into predominantly positive or negative groups. Thus,
                  comparing positive
	reactors with a combined group of nonreactors and negative
                  reactors
	obscures important differences among groups. Patients with
                  positive
	reactions to placebo tend to improve more rapidly and have a
                  better
	prognosis than patients with neutral and negative
                  reactions. Patients
	with absent and negative responses may respond to treatment
                  eveually
	but not as predictably as positive reactors. Other confirmed
                  predictions
	were that positive and negative placebo reactions would be
                  unrelated
	to older age, lower intelligence, authoritarianism, duration
                  and
	severity of illness, and diagnosis, and that placebo reaction
                  would
	be related to anxiety and depression. The placebo test may
                  combine
	the best features of a simple, standardized, quantitative, and
                  reliable
	laboratory test of suggestibility with the clinical relevance
                  and
	validity of the placebo effect. These conclusions are
                  qualified by
	the limitations of the study, particularly the small
                  sample. This
	paper should be considered a report of preliminary findings
                  which
	should be investigated further.},

                  considerable attention
	over the past several decades. The placebo effect has been
                  observed
	in different psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic
                  stress
	disorder (PTSD), a chronic and severe disorder precipitated by
                  exposure
	to a psychologically distressing event. The placebo response
                  rates
	in patients with PTSD range from 19% to 62%. A considerable
                  number
	of research publications suggest that endogenous opioids are
                  involved
	in the mechanisms of the placebo effect. Endogenous opioid
                  peptides
	play an important role in stress response and in the
                  pathophysiology
	of PTSD. Therefore, endogenous opioids may be involved in the
                  neurobiology
	of the placebo effect in PTSD. Possibly, the endogenous opioid
                  system
	mediates the effect of placebo on all 3 PTSD symptom clusters
                  (re-experiencing
	symptoms, avoidance and numbing, and physiologic arousal). The
                  placebo
	effect-related activation of the endogenous opioid system may
                  result
	in an improvement in intrusive symptomatology and symptoms of
                  increased
	arousal because the administration of exogenous opioids
                  improve these
	symptoms. The placebo effect-related activation of the
                  endogenous
	opioid system may have a mood-enhancing effect, and,
                  consequently,
	diminish avoidance and numbing. Multiple neurotransmitter and
                  neuroendocrine
	pathways may be involved in the mechanisms of the placebo
                  effect
	in PTSD. Further studies of the neurobiology of the placebo
                  effect
	on patients with PTSD and other psychiatric disorders may
                  produce
	interesting and important results.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The three objectives of this study were: (1)
                  to evaluate
	the effectiveness of Reiki as an adjunctive treatment for
                  patients
	with subacute stroke who were receiving standard
                  rehabilitation as
	inpatients, (2) to evaluate a double-blinded procedure for
                  training
	Reiki practitioners, and (3) to determine whether or not
                  double-blinded
	Reiki and sham practitioners could determine which category
                  they
	were in. Design: A modified double-blinded, placebo-controlled
                  clinical
	trial with an additional historic control condition. Setting:
                  The
	stroke unit of a major rehabilitation hospital. Subjects:
                  Fifty (50)
	inpatients with subacute ischemic stroke, 31 male and 19
                  female.
	Interventions: There were four conditions: Reiki master, Reiki
                  practitioner,
	sham Reiki, and no treatment (historic control). Subjects
                  received
	up to 10 treatments over a 2Ã‚Â½-week period in
                  addition to standard
	rehabilitation. Outcome measures: Functional independence
                  measure
	(FIM), and Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression
                  (CES-D)
	measure. Results: No effects of Reiki were found on the FIM or
                  CES-D,
	although typical effects as a result of age, gender, and time
                  in
	rehabilitation were detected. Blinded practitioners (sham or
                  reiki)
	were unable to determine which category they were in. Sham
                  Reiki
	practitioners reported greater frequency of feeling heat in
                  the hands
	compared to Reiki practitioners. There was no reported
                  difference
	between the sham and the real Reiki practitioners in their
                  ability
	to feel energy flowing through their hands. Post hoc analyses
                  suggested
	that Reiki may have had limited effects on mood and energy
                  levels.
	Conclusion: Reiki did not have any clinically useful effect on
                  stroke
	recovery in subacute hospitalized patients receiving
                  standard-of-care
	rehabilitation therapy. Selective positive effects on mood and
                  energy
	were not the result of attentional or placebo
                  effects. [ABSTRACT

                  pricing, can
	alter the actual efficacy of products to which they are

	These placebo effects stem from activation of expectancies
                  about
	the efficacy of the product, a process that appears not to be
                  conscious.
	In three experiments, the authors show that consumers who pay
                  a discounted
	price for a product (e.g., an energy drink thought to increase
                  mental
	acuity) may derive less actual benefit from consuming this

                  measurement
	of acute postprandial plasma glucose. What this study adds
                  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢
	Placebo effects may be operating on postprandial plasma
                  glucose outcomes.
	Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Cornstarch sources of placebo may
                  decrease the plasma glucose
	response to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, rendering them
                  as
	positive controls when assessing postprandial
                  outcomes. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Other
	carbohydrate sources used as placebos in research may show
                  similar
	effects. Aims Placebo effects in clinical trials remain
                  uncertain.
	To investigate a placebo effect on acute postprandial plasma
                  glucose,
	we conducted a follow-up investigation on a previous
                  study. Methods
	The effect of placebo (9 g encapsulated cornstarch +500 ml
                  water,
	taken at Ã¢Ë†â€™40 min) on the plasma
                  glucose response to a 75-g
	oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was assessed in a previous
                  study
	in 12 healthy subjects (gender, five male, seven female; age
                  27 Ã‚Â±
	6 years; body mass index 24 Ã‚Â± 3.4 kg
                  m<sup>Ã¢Ë†â€™2</sup>). This
	was compared with the effect of a water control (500 ml water
                  taken
	alone at Ã¢Ë†â€™40 min) on the same
                  outcome in the same subjects
	in a follow-up study. Results Cornstarch placebo decreased
                  plasma
	glucose area under the curve during the 75-g OGTT by 28%
                  [ÃŽ? (95%
	confidence interval) Ã¢Ë†â€™63.3 min

                  compared with the water control
	( P < 0.05). Conclusions Postprandial plasma glucose outcomes
                  may
	be vulnerable to placebo effects. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

                  characterised
	by a poor signal-to-noise ratio that is placebo related and
                  which
	distinguishes pharmacogenetic association studies from
                  classical
	case-control studies for disease susceptibility. The goal of
                  this
	study was to evaluate the statistical power of candidate gene
                  association
	studies under different pharmacogenetic scenarios, with
                  special emphasis
	on the placebo effect. Genotype/phenotype data were simulated,
                  mimicking
	samples from clinical trials, and response to the drug was
                  modelled
	as a binary trait. Association was evaluated by a logistic
                  regression
	model. Statistical power was estimated as a function of the
                  number
	of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped, the
                  frequency
	of the placebo 'response', the genotype relative risk (GRR) of
                  the
	response polymorphism, the strategy for selecting SNPs for
                  genotyping,
	the number of individuals in the trial and the ratio of
                  placebo-treated
	to drug-treated patients. We show that: (i) the placebo
                  'response'
	strongly affects the statistical power of association
                  studies--even
	a highly penetrant drug-response allele requires at least a
                  500-patient
	trial in order to reach 80 per cent power, several-fold more
                  than
	the value estimated by standard tools that are not calibrated
                  to
	pharmacogenetics; (ii) the power of a pharmacogenetic
                  association
	study depends primarily on the penetrance of the response
                  genotype
	and, when this penetrance is fixed, power decreases for larger
                  placebo
	effects; (iii) power is dramatically increased when adding
                  markers;
	(iv) an optimal study design includes a similar number of

	while volunteers experienced a painful stimulus and compared
                  it to
	that elicited when they observed a signal indicating that
                  their loved
	one-present in the same room-was receiving a similar pain
                  stimulus.
	Bilateral anterior insula (AI), rostral anterior cingulate
                  cortex
	(ACC), brainstem, and cerebellum were activated when subjects
                  received

	in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory cortex, the
                  sensorimotor

	its affective qualities, but not its sensory qualities,

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The placebo effect describes the mind-body
                  process of
	altering the body's physiological state as well as the brain's
                  neurological
	state. Catalyzed by the mind's believing in a certain drug,
                  ritual,
	and/or treatment, it generally refers to the phenomenon of an
                  ill
	individual recovering to health. Subsequent to the Prozac boom
                  (fluoxetine),
	which occurred during the 1980s and 90s in the United States,
                  a new
	form of placebogenic phenomena was defined: 'cosmetic
                  psychopharmacology',
	whereby the healthy individual is transformed to fit better in
                  his/her
	cultural medium (defined by one's values and beliefs). In
                  order to
	discover how cultural metaphors (e.g. media-generated
                  symbolism,
	social ideals) influence psychopharmacological treatment, this
                  report
	investigates the following questions: Is the Prozac Boom
                  culturally
	fashioned? Is cosmetic psychopharmacology culturally
                  fashioned? Are
	cosmetic psychopharmacology and its ability to better the
                  individual
	(relative to American ideals) a placebogenic phenomenon?
                  MATERIAL/METHODS:
	The data and speculation for the present report was obtained
                  via
	a cultural and critical review. RESULTS: It would appear that
                  (1)
	the Prozac Boom and subsequently its by product, cosmetic
                  psychopharmacology,
	are culturally fashioned; (2) cosmetic psychopharmacology is
                  considered
	to result from one's belief in a drug and thus is
                  placebo-influenced.
	CONCLUSIONS: Media-generated symbolism, which represents and
                  reciprocally
	fashions the ideals and values of that society, influence the
                  social
	perceptions of a drug's effectiveness and the quality of a
                  particular
	treatment. In the clinical setting, the influential role of
                  these
	preconceived notions about a certain treatment and/or drug

	In an effort to evaluate the discordant role of objective
                  uterine
	activity known to be associated with primary dysmenorrhea and
                  the

  abstract = {Background Irritable bowel syndrome is a poorly
                  understood disorder
	associated with abdominal pain, distension and altered bowel
                  habit,
	in the absence of any known pathology. A large number of
                  complementary
	medicine professions claim efficacy in its management,
                  including
	osteopathy.Objectives To summarise the evidence for both
                  complementary
	and orthodox approaches, in order to help practitioners
                  provide evidence-based
	management and advice to their patients.Methods A MEDLINE and
                  AHMED
	search was carried out for the period 1999 to 2005, in order
                  to locate
	systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, as well as recent
                  randomised
	controlled trials.Results Five reviews and two clinical
                  guidelines
	were located. Reviews comment that much of the research is of
                  poor
	quality, and many of the treatments used in IBS are of dubious
                  efficacy.
	All trials are associated with a high placebo response
                  rate. General
	management and dietary advice would seem to be helpful, though
                  this
	has not been confirmed in large RCTs. There is little evidence
                  to
	recommend the use of elimination diets, except in patients
                  with proven
	intolerance. There is some weak evidence to support the use of
                  fibre.
	There is some evidence for the role of traditional Chinese
                  medicine,
	Ayurvedic preparations and Tibetan herbal
                  medicine. Methodological
	issues make it difficult to draw conclusions about
                  psychological
	therapies, though they may be helpful in some patients,
                  however,
	they are resource intensive. There is some evidence to support
                  the
	role of loperamide, tegaserod, alosetron and anti-depressants
                  in
	certain patient groups.Discussion There is limited evidence to
                  support
	the role of some approaches to IBS management, although better
                  quality
	trials are needed. Whilst little research has been carried out
                  for
	a specific osteopathic approach, osteopaths are well placed to
                  incorporate
	some of the above approaches if adequately trained, or to
                  refer patients
	as appropriate. The lack of any clear approach to IBS
                  management
	may be due to the lack of understanding underlying the
                  pathophysiology
	of IBS, and the complex interaction of dietary, lifestyle and
                  psychological
	factors.},

                  continue to believe
	in the efficacy of subliminal message self-help (SMSH)
                  audiotapes.
	The authors contend that the value consumers attribute to
                  these tapes
	stems from the illusion of efficacy, the result of an
                  expectancy
	effect. Two double-blind studies tested subliminal message
                  self-help
	audiotapes claimed to improve memory, increase self-esteem, or
                  induce
	weight loss. Actual content and labeled content were
                  independently
	varied; some subjects believed they were using memory tapes
                  but were
	actually using weight loss or self-esteem tapes, and so
                  on. After
	a month of use (per manufacturers' recommendations) by
                  volunteer
	subjects, there were no effects of subliminal content in the
                  claimed
	direction on any of the three dimensions. In contrast, there
                  were
	changes or the perception of changes corresponding to the tape
                  labels.
	These placebo-like effects are hypothesized to result from
                  consumer
	expectancies. If consumers who forsake more conventional
                  treatments
	for SMSH audiotapes are misled, they suffer both the loss of
                  the
	price of the tapes and, more importantly, opportunity
                  costs. Thus,
	the potentially damaging consequences are a major concern from
                  a
	public policy perspective.},

  year = {1997},
  volume = {26(5) Pt 1},
  pages = {616-21},
  abstract = {A useful way to summarize the placebo-nocebo theme is to
                  consider
	the tension and interaction between conviction and
                  responsibility.
	With the conviction of the mainstream biomedical paradigm
                  prevalent
	today, it would be tempting to say to Dr. Engel's patient:
                  "That
	question is nonsense. Cancer pain is not classified as 'male'
                  or
	'female.' Pain varies with location in the body and other
                  factors."
	This response is technically honest but, in effect, it would
                  have
	the impact of a nocebo. It would impair the patient's hope and
                  morale.
	The doctor's honesty and conviction would serve as blinders to
                  the
	patient's suffering. This type of honest statement results in
                  a diminished
	sense of responsibility for the patient's well-being. Taking
                  the
	biopsychosocial context into account, Dr. Engel achieved a
                  balance
	between conviction and responsibility. The patient's question
                  was
	understood within the meaning and metaphorical terms of her
                  belief
	system. He answered in a manner that respected her private
                  point
	of view toward pain and tapped her suggestibility, guiding her
                  toward
	a probable placebo effect. "Female cancer" resonated with her
                  personal
	beliefs and wish for less pain. Engel was both true to his
                  convictions
	and responsible for providing the highest standard of care by
                  understanding
	the patient's convictions and needs for comfort. The
                  biopsychosocial
	concept provides a blueprint to bring the old-fashioned
                  medical art
	of "humanness" to modern scientific care. Identifying the
                  interactions
	of the problem, the person, and the totality of resources
                  permits
	a focus on therapeutic strategies to promote placebo effects

  abstract = {Opinion statement&nbsp;&nbsp;Irritable bowel syndrome
                  (IBS) is an
	extremely common cause of consultation, and at present is
                  diagnosed
	on the basis of symptoms and a few simple exclusion
                  tests. Exclusion
	diets can be successful, but many patients have already
                  attempted
	and failed such treatments before consulting. Anxiety and
                  somatization
	may be an important driver of consultation. Patientsâ€™
                  concerns
	should be understood and addressed. Those with prominent
                  psychiatric
	disease may benefit from psychotherapy. Hypnotherapy benefits
                  symptoms
	in those without psychologic disturbance, but its availability
                  is
	limited. Antidepressants are effective in improving both mood
                  and
	IBS symptoms globally, and the evidence is particularly good
                  for
	tricyclic antidepressants. Although antispasmodics are
                  currently
	the most commonly prescribed drugs, most responses (75%) are
                  due
	to the placebo effect and not specific to the drug. Bulk
                  laxatives
	such as ispaghula can increase stool frequency and help pain,
                  but
	bloating may be aggravated. Loperamide is effective treatment
                  for
	urgency and loose stools, but less effective for bloating and
                  pain.
	5-HT3 antagonists such as alosetron improve urgency, stool
                  consistency,
	and pain in diarrhea-predominant-IBS. The 5-HT4 agonist
                  tegaserod
	shows modest benefit in constipation-predominant IBS,
                  improving stool
	frequency, consistency, and bloating as well as global
                  improvement.
	There are many new drugs, such as cholecystokinin, neurokinin,
                  and
	corticotropin receptor antagonists, in development.},

	and cognitive-behavioral theories of pain and facilitates
                  development
	of a common vocabulary for pain research across
                  disciplines. Pain
	investigation proceeds in seven interacting realms: basic
                  biology,
	conditioned learning, language cognition, personality
                  differences,
	pain behavior, the social environment, and emotions. Because
                  pain
	is an emotional response, examining the bidirectional impact
                  of emotion
	is pivotal to understanding pain. Emotion influences each of
                  the
	other areas of interest and causes the impact of each factor
                  to amplify
	or diminish in an additive fashion. Research based on this
                  theory
	of pain has revealed the ameliorating impact on pain of (1)
                  improving
	mood by engaging in pleasant sexual fantasies, (2) reducing
                  anxiety,

	the theory to therapy improved the results of treatment of
                  osteoarthritic

                  considers
	the placebo a stimulus conditioned to elicit a positive
                  emotional
	response. This response is most powerful if it is elicited by
                  conditioned
	language. Research based on this theory of the placebo that
                  pain
	is ameliorated by a placebo suggestion and augmented by a
                  nocebo

                  seems

  abstract = {The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common
                  sensory-motor disorder
	of sleep/wake motor regulation with prevalence rates between
                  3% and
	10%. In its more severe forms, RLS is a burdening disorder
                  with disturbed
	sleep and significantly impaired quality of life. Restless
                  legs symptoms
	are dramatically relieved with levodopa and dopamine agonists,
                  which
	are first-line treatment for this disorder. In addition,
                  opioids
	have been shown to provide a marked symptomatic relief. This
                  unique
	responsiveness of RLS to both dopaminergic agents and opioids
                  places
	it at the crossroad of the two systems implicated in the
                  placebo
	response. Indeed, in recent large-scale studies a substantial
                  placebo
	response was observed. We performed a meta-analysis to provide
                  an
	evidence-based estimate of the magnitude of the placebo
                  response
	in RLS. Search strategies included the electronic databases
                  PubMed
	and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry (from 1966 to March
                  2007),
	the reference lists of retrieved articles, hand-searching
                  abstract
	books of sleep, neurology and movement disorder congresses and
                  visiting
	clinical trial register web sites. All randomized,
                  double-blind,
	placebo-controlled studies exploring a pharmacological
                  treatment
	in subjects with RLS were considered. Outcome measures from
                  five
	domains were extracted: RLS severity, subjective sleep
                  parameters,
	sleep parameters derived from nocturnal polysomnography,
                  periodic
	leg movements during sleep (PLMS) and daytime functioning. We
                  identified
	60 clinical trials and 36 of them were eligible for the
                  meta-analysis.
	In 24 trials, the pooled placebo response rate was 40.09% (95%
                  CI:
	31.99Ã¢â‚¬â€œ48.19). The placebo

                  To
	determine efficacy rates for placebo in patients with MDD; to
                  quantify

                  randomized, placebo-controlled

	using a random effects meta-analysis for per protocol (PP) and
                  intent-to-treat
	(ITT) results.RESULTS: We included 24 of 134 potential studies
                  examining
	4459 patients, 1786 on placebo and 2673 on an
                  antidepressant. Placebo

                  were
	significant between year and rates (PP rho 0.448, p = 0.042;
                  ITT
	rho 0.557; p = 0.006), but not for active drugs. Placebo and

	These placebo rates confirm those reported previously, but
                  were from
	a homogeneous population. Although statistically significant,
                  the

                  others
	reported. During the study period, placebo rates increased

	active drugs did not. Correlations between placebo and drug
                  response
	rates reflected moderate to strong effect sizes. We suggest

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore participants' experience in
                  placebo-controlled
	randomized clinical trials (RCTs) specifically in relationship
                  to
	their expectations. BACKGROUND: Aspects of being in RCTs, such
                  as
	informed consent, perception of benefit and understanding of
                  randomization,
	have been examined. In contrast, little is known concerning
                  the formation
	of patient expectations before and during trials. METHODS:
                  Qualitative
	methods using in-depth interviews with a semi-structured
                  interview
	guide of nine patients from four different RCTs. Data analysis
                  was
	conducted using a codebook format arranging participant
                  responses
	under broad analytical headings. The interviewer used a
                  semi-structured
	interview guide to direct the conversation from one broad
                  topic to
	the next within the context of the ongoing conversation. A
                  checklist
	of topics encouraged participants to describe their
                  experiences in
	RCTs. Narratives concerning expectation, blinding and placebo
                  were
	compared to identify common themes. RESULTS: Patient
                  anticipatory
	processes were influenced and modified both before and during
                  the
	trial from multiple inputs. Such factors as past experiences
                  in RCTs,
	past experiences of ineffective treatment, stress of being off
                  regular
	medications, fear of being a 'placebo responder', input of
                  non-study
	doctors or other health professionals, the experience of other
                  participants,
	measurements of health parameters made during the trial and
                  the presence
	or absence of side-effects all affected patient
                  expectation. CONCLUSION:
	Expectations in RCTs are not fixed and instead may be viewed
                  as continuously
	shaped by multiple inputs that include experience and
                  information
	received both before and during the trial. Variability in
                  placebo
	response observed in previous studies may be related to the
                  fluid
	nature of expectations. Trying to control and equalize
                  expectations
	in RCTs may be more difficult than previously assumed.},

	or location between the headaches experienced with the two
                  exposures
	types. In most participants, the headache was compatible with
                  tension-type
	headache. DISCUSSION: As participants experienced their
                  typical 'mobile
	phone headache' both with and without RF exposure, and since
                  the
	experiment did not involve the stress or the arm/head position
                  of
	mobile phone use, the most likely explanation is that the
                  headache
	in this situation is caused by negative expectations
                  (nocebo). CONCLUSION:
	This and other similar studies indicate that headache
                  occurring in
	connection with mobile phone use is not related to RF fields,
                  and
	that a nocebo effect is important for this and possibly other
                  headache
	triggers.},

                  outcomes,
	ESR and/or CRP as components of ACR response criteria to
                  assess efficacy.
	OBJECTIVES: Mean changes from baseline in patient- and
                  physician-reported
	outcome measures, ESR and CRP were compared in two RCTs in
                  patients
	with active RA. Comparisons between active and placebo
                  treatment
	used mean percentage improvements and standard effect sizes
                  (SESs).
	RESULTS: In both protocols, patient-reported assessments of
                  disease
	activity, pain and physical function reflected little or no
                  improvement
	with placebo, best discriminating between active and placebo
                  therapy,
	as did ESR and CRP. CONCLUSION: Improvements in signs and
                  symptoms
	of active RA in placebo RCTs appear to be best reflected by
                  patient-reported

                  global
	assessments of disease activity and/or pain reflect similar
                  benefit.
	Patient-reported outcome measures should be considered
                  objective;
	treatment-associated changes are congruent with measures of
                  inflammation,

                  clinical trials
	(PC-RCTs) are commonly used to assess therapies for Crohn's
                  disease
	(CD). Knowledge of the placebo rates of remission and response
                  and
	understanding of design factors that influence these rates is
                  important
	for designing future clinical trials evaluating
                  pharmacotherapy of
	CD. The aims of this study were to estimate rates of remission
                  and
	response in patients with active CD receiving placebo and to
                  identify
	factors influencing these rates. METHODS: We performed a
                  systematic
	review and meta-analysis of PC-RCTs evaluating therapies for
                  active
	CD identified from MEDLINE from 1966 to 2001. RESULTS: The
                  pooled
	estimates of the placebo rates of remission and response were
                  18%
	(95% confidence interval, 14%-24%; range, 0%-50%) and 19% (95%
                  confidence
	interval, 13%-28%; range, 0%-46%), respectively, both with
                  significant
	heterogeneity among studies (P < 0.01 for remission, P < 0.03
                  for
	response). In multivariate models, study duration, number of
                  study
	visits, and entry Crohn's Disease Activity Index score were
                  important
	predictors of the placebo remission rate, with study duration
                  the
	most important. However, no single factor could account for
                  all of
	the heterogeneity. Factors that influence the placebo response
                  rates
	were similar to those affecting the placebo remission
                  rates. The
	absolute benefit of active treatment beyond placebo was
                  generally
	larger when outcome was measured by response than
                  remission. CONCLUSIONS:
	Placebo remission and response rates in PC-RCTs for active CD
                  are
	variable. Study duration, number of study visits, and disease
                  severity

  abstract = {In the modern civilised world, magical thinking is
                  ousted from nature
	and finds its last refuge in art, religion and
                  imagination. Yet traces
	remain, in the everyday lives of both children and adults,
                  with some
	surprising and important implications. Psychological research
                  has
	shown that in healthy children, there is a significant
                  association
	between magical thinking and obsessive-compulsive thoughts and
                  behaviours.
	If pushed still further, obsessive-compulsive thinking can
                  develop
	into obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Here, magical
                  thinking
	enters the area of clinical research. In fact, magical
                  thinking constitutes
	a foundation for the way the individual and social mind
                  works. Human
	emotional and communicative reactions are literally based on
                  the
	laws of sympathetic magic. The phenomena of emotional
                  contagion,
	hypnotic suggestion, magical healing, and placebo effects are
                  just
	a small sample of those reactions. Magical thinking is
                  important
	for establishing and maintaining human relations. To conclude,
                  just
	as rational thinking helps to cope with problems in the
                  physical
	world, magical thinking comes to the aid when one deals with
                  problems
	in personal, social and emotional life. That is why magical
                  thinking
	goes well along with rational logic, and is an exciting topic
                  for
	psychological research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008

	(APS) opposes the inadequate treatment of pain using any
                  therapeutic
	modality including the use of placebo. The placebo effect is
                  ubiquitous
	in pain management, but the deceptive use of placebos and
                  misinterpretation
	of the placebo response to discredit the patient's pain report
                  are
	unethical. An analgesic effect from a placebo, moreover, does
                  not
	provide any useful information about the genesis or severity
                  of pain.
	The ethical use of placebos is justified only as a part of
                  studies
	of therapeutic efficacy in consenting subjects and not as
                  ongoing

	method. The centerpiece of such a method is a strategy for
                  identifying
	truly effective new therapies, i.e., the randomized clinical
                  trial
	(RCT). A crucial component of the RCT in illnesses without
                  established
	treatment is the placebo control. Placebo effects must be
                  identified

	and active treatment in the context of a clinical trial for

                  of
	specific dimensions of catastrophic thinking that influence
                  response
	to placebo and active treatment. Methods: A sample of 46
                  patients
	(26 men, 20 women) with neuropathic pain were randomly
                  assigned to
	a placebo (n = 24) or treatment (amitriptyline + ketamine)
                  condition
	(n = 22). All patients completed the Pain Catastrophizing
                  Scale prior
	to treatment. Results: There were no significant differences
                  between
	placebo and active treatment on pain reduction. In the placebo
                  condition,
	high scores on the PCS were associated with greater pain
                  reduction
	(r = 0.42, p < 0.05), while in the treatment condition, higher
                  PCS
	scores were associated with less pain reduction (r = -0.51, p
                  < 0.01).
	Additional analyses revealed that individuals in the active
                  treatment
	condition reported slightly more side effects than individuals
                  in
	the placebo condition, and that catastrophizing was
                  significantly
	correlated with the report of side effects (r = 0.29, p <
                  0.05).
	Conclusion: Catastrophizing appears to have a differential
                  impact
	on treatment response to placebo and active treatment. Given
                  that
	side effects are more likely with active treatments than
                  placebos,
	high levels of catastrophizing might impact negatively on
                  active
	treatment effects but not necessarily on placebo
                  effects. Discussion
	addresses how pain catastrophizing may contribute to null
                  findings
	in clinical trials of interventions for pain

                  cognitive

                  treated with active
	drug has significant clinical and research implications. In
                  clinical
	practice, when a patient treated with medication improves,
                  this improvement
	may be attributed to the chemical component of the drug
                  itself, a
	"placebo effect," or some combination of these. Determining
                  the proper
	subsequent treatment and maintenance of the patient may be
                  greatly
	aided by understanding the mechanism of patient
                  improvement. In a
	research context, classification of patient response has
                  bearing
	on how efficacy and effectiveness clinical trials are designed
                  and
	conducted. This article presents a framework for studying
                  placebo
	response in diverse areas of medicine. To identify placebo
                  responders
	among drug-treated patients, a profile of the clinical status
                  over
	time (outcome profile) is estimated for each
                  subject. Self-consistent
	partitioning techniques are used to group subjects based on
                  the amount
	of curvature in the profile as well as the overall trend in
                  the profile.
	The resulting partitions determine representative profiles for
                  subjects
	in the drug group that subsequently can be used to classify
                  patients.
	The proposed method is applied to data from a clinical trial
                  for
	treatment of depression involving placebo and the active drug
                  phenelzine.
	Data from the placebo arm of the study is used to help
                  validate the
	procedure, because the drug-treated and placebo-treated
                  subjects
	should share common profiles.},

                  explored

                  conditions
	and to interpreting placebo effects. Cochair Mark Fillmore
                  began
	with an overview of the use of placebo conditions in alcohol
                  research,
	focusing on methodological issues. Jeanette Norris and her
                  colleagues
	conducted a review of studies examining placebo conditions
                  among
	women. They conclude that expectancy effects are limited to a
                  few
	domains. Maria Testa and Antonia Abbey presented papers
                  suggesting
	that placebo manipulations may result in unanticipated
                  compensatory
	effects in actual or hypothetical social situations. That is,
                  placebo
	participants may compensate for anticipated cognitive
                  impairment
	through vigilant attention to situational cues. John Curtin's

	suggests that the compensatory strategies of placebo
                  participants
	appear to involve a sensitization of evaluative control,
                  resulting
	in improved performance. Kenneth Leonard provided concluding

	on the meaning of placebo effects and the value of placebo

	a vainglorious ruler is duped into wearing an imaginary

	Kirsch, T. J. Moore, A. Scoboria, & S. S. Nicholls (2002) draw
                  upon
	this tale in their study, the results of which demonstrate yet
                  again
	that antidepressants have modest effects in a meta-analysis of
                  placebo-controlled
	randomized clinical trials. The present commentary does not
                  dispute
	these main findings but does call into question the authors'
                  choice
	of metaphor and their contention that such modest effects are
                  negligible
	in clinical practice. Moreover, it is asserted that part of

	industry in pursuit of regulatory approval, not just that the

	of depression, including various time-limited psychotherapies,
                  are
	subject to the same biases and criticisms as those evaluating

  abstract = {Abstract:This paper considers how the full range of
                  human
	experience may catalyze a placebo response. The placebo effect
                  has
	been characterized as something to control in clinical
                  research,
	something to cultivate in clinical practice and something
                  present
	in all healing encounters. We examine domains in which the
                  term â€˜placeboâ€™
	is used in discourse: clinical research, clinical practice,
                  media
	representations of treatment efficacy and lay interpretations
                  of
	placeboâ€”an underresearched topic. We briefly review
                  major theoretical
	frameworks proposed to explain the placebo effect: classical
                  conditioning,
	expectancy, the therapeutic relationship and sociocultural
                  â€˜meaning.â€™
	As a corrective to what we see as an overemphasis on conscious
                  cognitive
	approaches to understanding placebo, we reorient the
                  discussion to
	argue that direct embodied experience may take precedence over
                  meaning-making
	in the healing encounter. As an example, we examine the
                  neurobiology
	of rehearsing or visualizing wellness as a mode of directly
                  (performatively)
	producing an outcome often dismissed as a â€˜placebo
                  response.â€™
	Given body/mind/emotional resonance, we suggest that the
                  placebo
	response is an evolutionarily adaptive trait and part of
                  healing
	mechanisms operating across many levelsâ€”from
                  genetic and cellular
	to social and cultural.},

                  effect" in double-blind,
	medical experiments has strongly increased. This paper asks
                  why and
	how. Starting with the human "psychophysiologic principle,"
                  two unconscious
	and one conscious biofeedback examples are given to
                  demonstrate how
	malleable we humans are to our expectations and our intentions
                  and
	how strong our psychoenergetic forces can be relative to
                  conventional
	chemical forces. Ending with several experimental examples
                  wherein
	a therapeutically processed device and an unprocessed device
                  are
	critically compared, one finds strong evidence to propose that
                  an
	information entanglement process is converting the unprocessed
                  device
	to a functional replica of the processed device in that its
                  therapeutic
	efficacy is comparable to that of the treatment
                  device. Furthermore,
	arguments are provided to indicate that a practitioner's
                  biofield
	is capable of expanding the range of diagnostic capability of
                  commercial
	measurement instruments so that the practitioner/device hybrid
                  system
	becomes a potent psychoenergetic instrument for diagnostic and
                  treatment
	purposes. In between, a theoretical model is provided, based
                  on the
	author's extensive experimental psychoenergetic research on
                  long-range
	interconnectivity between objects, between humans and between
                  humans
	and objects, to show how long-range, quantitative coupling can
                  occur
	between our normal atom/molecule level of physical reality and
                  a
	second, unique level of physical reality whose physics can be
                  modulated
	by psychoenergetic forces. It is the material qualities of
                  this duplex
	physical reality that convert a seemingly inert object/device
                  (placebo)
	into a synergistically active element in double-blind placebo
                  experiments.

  abstract = {Abstract.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a fact that without ideas
                  there is nothing.
	Without ideas and without innovations there is nothing to
                  test. An
	interesting, often asked question is: How are ideas,
                  innovations
	born? It is surely correct that people giving birth to ideas
                  have
	special characteristics. These creative people are different
                  but
	still have many, maybe essential, characteristics in
                  common. They
	are open-minded. Abnormality is interesting for them. They are
                  highly
	emotional, passionate. They are intelligent and naive at the
                  same
	time. They are often like children but they also are
                  determined and
	enjoy their lives. It is a fact that an idea, once born, does
                  not
	always attain fruition; place, time, social environment, and
                  society
	have to fit. The domain has to be prepared for it. The true
                  pioneer
	is the one who has seen the beginning to a certain degree but
                  also
	brings the new idea to the public, places it on the agenda,
                  accompanies
	it with positive skepticism, and most of all carries it over
                  the
	â€œfinishing line.? Giving birth to an idea
                  is an important step.
	Testing the idea regarding its effectivity is a
                  necessity. Since
	Decartes, in our Western way of thinking, we have a systematic
                  methodic
	procedure. The idea is expressed in a hypothesis. Here the
                  hypothesis
	is: â€œEndoscopic surgery supplies more comfort and
                  means less trauma
	at the same or greater safety.? This is the idea, the
                  dream, the
	hypothesis. In concrete terms it means less pestering, less
                  pain,
	less fatigue, and in general a quicker return to daily life
                  during
	the pre- and postoperative course. Less trauma means less
                  stress
	response of the body; these are the true endpoints. In the
                  long run,
	endoscopic surgery meansâ€”this being the unproved
                  prerequisiteâ€”physical
	integrity, less immunosuppression, and last but not least
                  consideration
	of the abdominal wall (in concrete terms, fewer incisional
                  hernias).
	Thus the relevant endpoints have been formulated by the
                  concrete
	terms of the hypothesis. This makes clear that comfort relates
                  toâ€”and
	this is for the first
                  timeâ€”â€œsoft? data. This
                  is the true revolution.
	For me this is a true change of paradigm. Here a few important
                  problems
	become evident. In the first place, a solution must be
                  foundâ€”with
	the intention of reality and coolnessâ€”for the
                  problem of comparing
	â€œsoft? and â€œhard?
                  data. With this problem it must be clear
	that subjective endpoints strongly depend on social and
                  cultural
	circumstances and are probably influenced more by these
                  factors than
	by the endoscopic surgery itself. The placebo effect must also
                  be
	considered. Up to 50% of the subjective endpoints are due to
                  the
	placebo effect, especially with surgery. For example, pain and
                  return
	to work depend heavily on socioeconomic aspects and the
                  placebo effect.
	In summary, the first step is the idea; the second step is
                  testing
	the idea for effectiveness. Endoscopic surgery as a
                  patient-friendly
	treatment is the idea, the hypothesis. This hypothesis must be
                  tested
	according to our present standard of methodology. In addition
                  to
	the â€œconventional? endpoints (negative
                  events), the comfort of
	the patient is the true endpoint of patient-friendly
                  surgeryâ€”endoscopic
	surgery.},

  abstract = {Recently the development of several promising new
                  compounds for anxiety
	and depression was discontinued because of difficulty
                  demonstrating
	a therapeutic effect. Disappointed firms and investigators
                  attributed
	the problem to an increasing placebo response over the
                  decades. This
	presentation explores an alternative explanation. In the NIMH
                  Collaborative
	Study on the Psychotherapy of Outpatient Depression, treatment
                  differences
	were not visible in the full sample, but were quite clear in
                  the
	subsample that was more depressed at baseline. We reanalyzed a
                  study
	of 81 panic patients to investigate the effect of baseline
                  pathology
	on treatment contrasts in anxiety. Patients were assigned at
                  random,
	double-blind, to 1 of 4 treatment arms: placebo, alprazolam 2
                  mg,
	alprazolam 6 mg, and imipramine 225 mg (daily fixed
                  doses). The regression
	of final on initial number of attacks differed among the
                  treatment
	groups, with lower slopes for the more active compounds,
                  according
	to expectation. Treatment contrasts were apparent only among
                  patients
	with many panic attacks at baseline. Analyses of variance
                  dividing
	the sample at the median number of baseline panic attacks
                  showed
	no treatment differences in the less ill subsample and marked
                  treatment
	differences in the more ill subsample. Current factors that
                  may operate
	to exclude more anxious patients from therapeutic trials
                  include:
	1) increasing availability of treatment; 2) proliferation of
                  large
	therapeutic trials; 3) increasing pressure to complete trials
                  rapidly;
	4) delay of active treatment during "placebo washout" and
                  complex
	workup; 5) increasing IRB requirements to emphasize the
                  negative
	aspects of participation in research for "informed" consent;
                  6) increasing
	protocol requirements for investigators to adopt a
                  non-therapeutic
	stance in response to the belief that support increases
                  placebo response.
	These circumstances may produce study samples of anxious
                  patients
	with a relatively higher placebo response rate!},

                  large
	difference between drug and placebo and a low rate of placebo
                  response.

  abstract = {Objectives: Acupuncture has been promoted for the
                  treatment of chronic
	pain. Though many randomized trials have been conducted, these
                  have
	been criticized for deficiencies of methodology, acupuncture
                  technique,
	and sample size. Somewhat less emphasis has been placed on
                  methods
	of statistical analysis. This paper describes 4 recent
                  randomized
	trials of acupuncture for musculoskeletal or headache
                  pain. Each
	trial used statistical methods that did not adjust for
                  baseline pain
	scores and were thus of suboptimal power. The objective of
                  this study
	is to reanalyze the trials using analysis of covariance
                  (ANCOVA).
	Methods: Raw data for the 4 trials were obtained from the
                  original
	authors. Data were reanalyzed by ANCOVA. Results: For 2
                  trials--acupuncture
	versus placebo for chronic headache and acupuncture versus
                  transcutaneous
	electric nerve stimulation for back pain--reanalysis did not
                  change
	the conclusion of no difference between groups, but showed
                  that clinically
	significant differences between groups could not ruled
                  out. Reanalysis
	of a trial of acupuncture versus placebo for shoulder pain
                  slightly
	strengthened the evidence of acupuncture
                  effectiveness. Reanalysis
	of the fourth trial, which compared acupuncture to placebo
                  acupuncture
	and massage for neck pain, reversed the results of the
                  original paper:
	reanalysis found acupuncture to be effective and that its
                  effectiveness
	could not be ascribed to a placebo effect. Discussion: Future
                  trials
	of acupuncture and other modalities for pain should use
                  efficient
	statistical methods. ANCOVA is more efficient than unadjusted
                  analysis
	where used appropriately. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Placebo response is high in bipolar disorder
                  trials. This
	is a challenge for researchers and an enigma for
                  clinicians. This
	article will attempt to aid in the comprehension of the
                  ethical questions
	and methodologies related to the use of placebo in bipolar
                  disorder.
	METHODS: A systematic review of the main computerized data
                  bases
	(Medline, Embase, Psychlit, Current Contents) was carried out,
                  using
	the following key words: placebo, bipolar disorder, mania,
                  depression,
	clinical trial. RESULTS: Placebo has a very important role in
                  the
	study of bipolar disorders. From a methodological point of
                  view,
	and given the limitations of non-inferiority designs, the use
                  of
	placebo is necessary to evaluate the sensitivity of the study
                  and
	ensure that the drug under investigation is really
                  effective. For
	this reason, several procedures may be used to satisfactorily
                  solve
	the ethical objections. Placebo response in bipolar disorder
                  trials
	is more likely to occur in patients who are mildly ill,
                  bipolar II,
	mixed-episode, first-episode, rapid cycling, atypical,
                  non-psychotic,
	substance abusers and medically ill. The use of concomitant
                  medication
	such as benzodiazepines, a high frequency of visits, a high
                  number
	of treatment groups and sites, fixed-dose designs, and the
                  concomitant
	use of psychotherapy are likely to increase placebo
                  response. CONCLUSION:
	The subject of the use of placebo in psychiatric clinical
                  trials
	leads to very relevant ethical, methodological and clinical
                  dilemmas.
	Many reasons support the use of placebo in acute bipolar
                  studies,
	whereas in maintenance the length of the treatment with
                  placebo makes
	the decision more difficult. Ethical concerns can be addressed
                  through
	operational definitions of outcome measures, add-on and
                  discontinuation
	designs, early escape strategies, and processes designed to
                  make
	sure that fully informed consent was fairly obtained. There
                  are a
	number of clinical and methodological variables that are
                  associated
	with placebo response. Copyright 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

                  glucose
	metabolism, which we used as a marker of brain function and
                  tested
	them under four randomized conditions (1) expecting placebo
                  and receiving
	placebo; (2) expecting placebo and receiving methylphenidate;
                  (3)
	expecting methylphenidate and receiving methylphenidate; (4)
                  expecting
	methylphenidate and receiving placebo. We show that
                  methylphenidate-induced
	decreases in striatum were greater when subjects expected to
                  receive
	methylphenidate than when they were not expecting it. We also
                  show
	that the subjects' expectations affected their responses to
                  placebo.
	That is, when subjects expected to receive methylphenidate but
                  received
	placebo there were significant increases in ventral cingulate
                  gyrus
	(BA 25) and nucleus accumbens (regions involved with emotional
                  reactivity
	and reward). The effect was largest in subjects who, because
                  of experimental
	randomization, had not experienced methylphenidate. Because
                  subjects
	were told that methylphenidate could be experienced as
                  pleasant,
	unpleasant or devoid of subjective effects these results
                  suggest
	the involvement of the ventral cingulate and of the nucleus
                  accumbens
	in processing expectation for "uncertain drug effects". Thus,
                  the
	state of expectation needs to be considered as a variable
                  modulating
	the reinforcing and therapeutic effects of drugs even in
                  subjects
	who have no prior experience with the drug.},

	medicines: the difficulties of using placebo within the
                  context of
	evidence-based medicine, which represents the current standard
                  for
	pharmacotherapy in most western culture countries. It
                  discusses the
	possibility of placebo having a similar or better
                  benefitÃ¢â‚¬â€œrisk
	profile compared with an active compound in some diseases, and

	three examples in which this can be concluded from a clinical
                  trial
	(insomnia, allergic rhinitis, irritable bowel disease). It is
                  proposed
	that complementary medicine has under these circumstances
                  taken the
	place of placebo therapy. By this, the commentary does not
                  deny (and
	does not discuss) the possibility of an effect of
                  complementary medicines
	other than the placebo effect. However, it recognizes that
                  complementary
	medicine is open to the therapeutic application of the placebo
                  effect
	by using a medicine with the claim that it has worked in
                  similar
	situations and may work in the actual patient, without
                  requiring
	hard data showing superiority to placebo. Physicians might be
                  more
	open to the use of complementary medicines for indications in
                  which
	the placebo effect is high, the conventional therapy carries a
                  risk
	of side-effects and the omission of treatment with a
                  pharmacologically
	active compound does not result in irreversible damage. The
                  regulators
	on their part should probably not require proof of
                  effectiveness
	compared with placebo in controlled clinical trials. However,
                  whenever
	used in this sense, the complementary medicine product must
                  unequivocally
	demonstrate its safety with respect to both the ingredients
                  and the
	pharmaceutical quality. This is unfortunately not always the

                  non-drug,
	or a part of it which, in the condition being treated,
                  objectively
	does not have any specific pharmacodynamic action." Even today
                  when
	powerful drugs are available placebo is important and present
                  in
	therapy. Effective therapeutic agents are also sometimes used
                  as
	placebo, mostly inadvertently. In clinical pharmacological
                  investigations
	placebos are used deliberately to discriminate the
                  pharmacodynamic
	action of drugs from psychic and other factors which can
                  influence
	the objective of the drug evalution. The use of placebo in
                  therapeutic
	trials is justified only when no effective treatment is
                  available
	or the symptom or disease is trivial. Placebo effect is
                  especially
	pronounced in diseases where pain is an important symptom as
                  well
	as in psychosomatic diseases. The extent of placebo reaction
                  depends
	on patient's characteristics (reactors and non-reactors), drug
                  presentation,
	as well as on personality and attitudes of the
                  prescriber. Deliberate
	use of placebo other than in clinical therapeutic
                  investigation is
	justified in mild mental depression and in situations where
                  the diagnosis
	is known, no drug is necessary, but the patient's pressure to
                  get
	a prescription is irresistible (?). Every doctor should
                  cultivate
	the induction of placebo reaction in treatment of his patient,
                  but
	not to the extent that the belief of the former in the action
                  of
	an inactive medication starts.},

  abstract = {Placebo effects are beneficial effects of treatment
                  caused not by
	the biological action of the treatment but by one's response
                  to the
	treatment process itself. One possible mechanism of placebo
                  treatments
	is that they create positive expectations, which change one's
                  appraisal
	of the situation and may thereby shape sensory and emotional
                  processing.
	Recent brain-imaging evidence suggests that placebo-induced
                  expectations
	of analgesia increase activity in the prefrontal cortex in
                  anticipation
	of pain and decrease the brain's response to painful
                  stimulation.
	These findings suggest that placebo treatments can alter
                  experience,
	not just alter what participants are willing to report about
                  pain.
	To the extent that they involve neural systems mediating
                  expectancy
	and appraisal, placebo effects in pain may share common
                  circuitry
	with placebo effects in depression, Parkinson's disease, and
                  other

                  pain in a
	manner reversible by opioid antagonists, but little is known
                  about
	the central brain mechanisms of opioid release during placebo
                  treatment.
	This study examined placebo effects in pain by using
                  positron-emission
	tomography with [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil, which measures
                  regional
	ÃŽÂ¼-opioid receptor availability in vivo. Noxious
                  thermal stimulation
	was applied at the same temperature for placebo and control
                  conditions.
	Placebo treatment affected endogenous opioid activity in a
                  number
	of predicted ÃŽÂ¼-opioid receptor-rich regions
                  that play central
	roles in pain and affect, including periaqueductal gray and
                  nearby
	dorsal raphe and nucleus cuneiformis, amygdala. orbitofrontal
                  cortex,
	insula, rostral anterior cingulate, and lateral prefrontal
                  cortex.
	These regions appeared to be subdivided into two sets, one
                  showing
	placebo-induced opioid activation specific to noxious heat and
                  the
	other showing placebo-induced opioid reduction during warm
                  stimulation
	in anticipation of pain. These findings suggest that a
                  mechanism
	of placebo analgesia is the potentiation of endogenous opioid
                  responses
	to noxious stimuli. Opioid activity in many of these regions
                  was
	correlated with placebo effects in reported pain. Connectivity
                  analyses
	on individual differences in endogenous opioid system activity
                  revealed
	that placebo treatment increased functional connectivity
                  between
	the periaqueductal gray and rostral anterior cingulate, as
                  hypothesized
	a priori, and also increased connectivity among a number of
                  limbic
	and prefrontal regions, suggesting increased functional
                  integration
	of opioid responses. Overall, the results suggest that
                  endogenous
	opioid release in core affective brain regions is an integral
                  part
	of the mechanism whereby expectancies regulate affective and

                  with

	`works'. If pharmacologists and clinicians have corporeally

	the concept of efficacy in terms of bio-availability,

                  century
	onwards medical anthropologists (especially those who became
                  interested
	in the `savage mind') have built up an equally rigorous theory
                  of

                  effect (as
	opposed to suggestion) could emerge in the middle of the 20th
                  century.
	Taking the example of St John's Wort, I go on to show how

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Placebo response rates in
                  clinical trials
	vary considerably and are observed frequently. For new drugs
                  it can
	be difficult to prove effectiveness superior to placebo. It is
                  unclear
	what contributes to improvement in the placebo groups. We
                  wanted
	to clarify, what elements of clinical trials determine placebo
                  variability.
	METHODS: We analysed a representative sample of 141 published
                  long-term
	trials (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled; duration
                  >
	12 weeks) to find out what study characteristics predict
                  placebo
	response rates in various diseases. Correlational and
                  regression
	analyses with study characteristics and placebo response rates
                  were
	carried out. RESULTS: We found a high and significant
                  correlation
	between placebo and treatment response rate across diseases (r
                  =
	.78; p < .001). A multiple regression model explained 79% of
                  the
	variance in placebo variability (F = 59.7; p <
                  0.0001). Significant
	predictors are, among others, the duration of the study (beta
                  = .31),
	the quality of the study (beta = .18), the fact whether a
                  study is
	a prevention trial (beta = .44), whether dropouts have been
                  documented
	(beta = -.20), or whether additional treatments have been
                  documented
	(beta = -.17). Healing rates with placebo are lower in the
                  following
	diagnoses; neoplasms (beta = -.21), nervous diseases (beta =
                  -.10),
	substance abuse (beta = -.14). Without prevention trials the
                  amount
	of variance explained is 42%. CONCLUSION: Medication response
                  rates
	and placebo response rates in clinical trials are highly
                  correlated.
	Trial characteristics can explain some portion of the variance
                  in

	in the study. Two EXs were led to expect placebo either to
                  produce
	physiological effects or not (pro- vs antiplacebo). All Ss
                  except
	a control group received a caffeine placebo. They were either
                  made
	to expect coffee, no coffee, or were in a double-blind
                  condition.
	Dependent measures were blood pressure, heart rate,
                  well-being, and
	cognitive task. There was 1 main effect on the instruction
                  factor
	with the group "told no caffeine" reporting significantly
                  better
	well-being. There was 1 main effect on the EX factor with Ss
                  instructed
	by experimenter "proplacebo" having higher systolic blood
                  pressure.
	There was 1 interaction with Ss instructed by EX "proplacebo"
                  to
	receive coffee doing worse in the cognitive task than the
                  rest. Ss
	instructed by EX "antiplacebo" were significantly less likely
                  to
	believe the experimental instruction, and that mostly if they
                  had
	been instructed to receive coffee. Contrary to the literature
                  the
	authors could not show an effect of instruction, but there was
                  an
	effect of EXs. It is likely, however, that these EX effects
                  were

	and medicine alone, but should be extended to the therapeutic

	the complementary therapist are a major factor in producing
                  positive
	health outcomes. Furthermore, the personality, presentation,

	calculation (TOTPAR), the LOW group had 65.1% TOTPAR vs. 41.0%
                  in

                  had 7.7%

                  inert cream
	in the guise of a local anaesthetic in conjunction with
                  conditioning.
	We investigated non-site-specific placebo analgesia by
                  conditioning
	subjects to expect the anaesthetic cream on one arm, without
                  specifying
	if they will definitely receive the cream, or to which arm it
                  might
	be applied. Painful heat pulses (150 ms) from a CO2 laser were
                  delivered
	randomly to both arms. A treatment group (n=24) underwent
                  three experimental
	blocks (pre-cream, conditioning after cream, and
                  post-conditioning).
	During the conditioning block, the intensity of the stimulus
                  was
	reduced on one arm only. In the post-conditioning block it was
                  returned
	to the painful level. We evaluated the change of intensity
                  rating
	post-conditioning compared to the pre-cream block. In contrast
                  to
	a control group (n=16), the treatment group reported a
                  significant
	reduction in intensity ratings (F(1,38)=12.1; p=0.001). In the
                  treatment
	group, we observed a range of placebo responses: unilateral
                  responders
	(33.3%), subjects with a placebo response in the conditioned

	in the intensity ratings in both arms, and non-responders,
                  whose
	intensity ratings were not influenced by conditioning. We
                  discuss
	these responses in terms of different levels of expected
                  analgesia,
	facilitated by the absence of a site-specific focus for the
                  treatment.

	data pooled from randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre
                  studies.
	Results: The efficacy of placebo on clinical symptoms and
                  outcome
	varied between the therapeutic indications. However, no
                  placebo effects

	The mechanisms of placebo effects are manyfold and varied

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to review
                  issues related
	to the use of placebo medication in a study examining combined
                  pharmacotherapy
	and psychotherapy for alcohol dependence. METHOD: Little is
                  known
	about the strength of the placebo effect in alcohol-dependent
                  patients.
	One way to study this is to compare placebo to no
                  pharmacological
	treatment. The multisite National Institute on Alcohol Abuse
                  and
	Alcoholism COMBINE Study is examining optimal combinations of
                  two
	medications (acamprosate and naltrexone) and two behavioral
                  treatments
	(a moderate-intensity treatment called Combined Behavioral
                  Intervention
	[CBI] and a low-intensity treatment called Medical Management
                  [MM])
	for alcohol-dependent patients. The study initially included a
                  2
	x 2 x 2 eight-cell design. This article relates our experience
                  adding
	a ninth treatment condition (Cell 9), consisting of CBI alone,
                  with
	no pills or MM. By comparing patients receiving CBI alone to
                  patients
	receiving two placebos, MM and CBI, we can examine the
                  strength of
	the placebo effect for these two medications in
                  alcohol-dependent
	patients. Moreover, we can study CBI in the context in which
                  it is
	frequently delivered clinically, that is, in the absence of
                  pharmacotherapy
	and certainly in the absence of placebo medication. RESULTS:
                  This
	article explains the background and rationale behind the
                  decision
	to include Cell 9 in COMBINE. Recruitment challenges faced as
                  a result
	of adding this condition are reviewed, as is the experience
                  implementing
	this condition in a pilot feasibility study. CONCLUSIONS: The
                  use
	of a "psychotherapy with no pills" treatment condition as part
                  of
	a combined pharmacotherapy-psychotherapy study of alcohol
                  dependence
	is feasible and can help enrich the results of this
                  research.},

                  in the healing
	processes used by ancient and non-Western healers. In this
                  paper,
	I suggest that practitioners of Western medicine also interact
                  with
	patients in a highly ritualized manner. Medical rituals, like
                  religious
	rituals, serve to alter the meaning of an experience by naming
                  and
	circumscribing unknown elements of that experience and by
                  enabling
	patients' belief in a treatment and their expectancy of
                  healing from
	that treatment. These are all critical elements necessary to
                  mobilize
	the potent placebo effects reported elsewhere to result from
                  doctor-patient
	interactions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of

                  patients
	were randomly assigned to either placebo or no treatment. The
                  authors
	found that, as compared with no treatment, placebo had no
                  significant
	effect on binary outcomes. For the trials with continuous
                  outcomes,
	placebo had a beneficial effect, but the effect decreased with
                  increasing
	sample size, indicating a possible bias related to the effects
                  of
	small trials. The pooled standardized mean difference was
                  significant

	outcomes. In the present article, the authors address the
                  shortcomings

	the failure of the researchers to verify that patients in a

                  reduction
	of clinical symptoms in biofeedback therapy. Previously,
                  nonspecified
	perceptual, cognitive, and emotional factors related to threat
                  perception
	(Wickramasekera, 1979, 1988, 1998) may account for the bulk of
                  the
	variance in the reduction of clinical symptoms. The mean
                  magnitude
	of these previously nonspecified or placebo factors is closer
                  to
	70\% when both the therapist and patient believe in the
                  efficacy of
	the therapy. This powerful placebo effect is hypothesized to
                  be an elicited conditioned
	response (Wickramasekera, 1977a, 1977c, 1980, 1985) based on
                  the
	memory of prior healings. These memories of healing are more
                  resistant
	to extinction if originally acquired on a partial rather than
                  continuous
	reinforcement schedule. High and low hypnotic ability in
                  interaction

                  contribute
	to both the production and reduction of clinical
                  symptoms. High and
	low hypnotic ability respectively are hypothesized to be
                  related
	to dysregulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic arms
                  of the
	autonomic nervous system. Biofeedback is hypothesized to be
                  most
	effective for reducing clinical symptoms in people of low to
                  moderate
	hypnotic ability. For people high in trait hypnotic ability,
                  training
	in self-hypnosis or other instructional procedures (e.g.,
                  autogenic
	training, progressive muscle relaxation, mediation, CBT, etc.)

  abstract = {Objective. In this post hoc observational study, we
                  investigated psychological
	predictors of outcome after radiofrequency and injection
                  treatments,
	commonly performed in the management of chronic low back pain
                  (CLBP).
	Design & Setting. Data, comprising 161 patients (29 eventually
                  lost
	to follow-up), were obtained from two randomized controlled
                  trials
	on efficacy of radiofrequency treatment for back pain and
                  sciatica.
	Subsequently patients were additionally treated in an open
                  prospective
	follow-up period. Although all groups presented a significant
                  visual
	analog scale reduction after 3 and 12 months, no additional
                  pain
	relief after radiofrequency compared with injection treatment
                  was
	found. Both trial populations showed sufficient
                  similarities. A principal
	component (factor) analysis was performed on baseline
                  psychometric
	tests, SF-36, and physical activity variables. We constructed
                  five
	clinically relevant psychological profiles: psychologically
	negative,adaptive manager,rigid qualities,supporting
	partner, and strong ego. These were examined
	as possible predictors of significant pain relief using
                  logistic
	regression analysis. Results. The psychologically negative
                  dimension showed a negative and the adaptive manager
	dimension a positive prognostic effect on
                  outcome. Conclusions. Minimally
	invasive treatment for CLBP leads to significant pain
                  reduction,
	including potential placebo effects. However, psychologically
                  vulnerable
	patients, characterized by, among others, reduced life
                  control, disturbed
	mood, negative self-efficacy, catastrophizing, high anxiety
                  levels,
	inadequacy, and poor mental health, tend not to respond to
                  this treatment.
	Patients characterized by a.o. reduced pain and interference
                  levels,
	positive expectations, and reasonable physical and social
                  functioning,

                  that explanation
	in the special sciences involves subsumption under
                  laws. According
	to this alternative, whether or not a generalization can be
                  used
	to explain has to do with whether it is invariant rather than
                  with
	whether it is lawful. A generalization is invariant if it is
                  stable
	or robust in the sense that it would continue to hold under a
                  relevant
	class of changes. Unlike lawfulness, invariance comes in
                  degrees
	and has other features that are well suited to capture the
                  characteristics
	of explanatory generalizations in the special sciences. For
                  example,
	a generalization can be invariant even if it has exceptions or
                  holds
	only over a limited spatio-temporal interval. The notion of
                  invariance
	can be used to resolve a number of dilemmas that arise in
                  standard

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient expectations may be an important
                  component of
	a placebo effect, and yet few studies assess how patients'
                  pre-existing
	expectations affect subsequent health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To
                  estimate
	the association between patients' expectations and time to
                  cure in
	patients with clinically diagnosed acute bacterial
                  rhinosinusitis.
	METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, expectations about
                  the
	benefit of an antibiotic therapy were measured prior to
                  treatment
	with either an antibiotic or placebo. RESULTS: Of the patients
                  asked
	for consent, 64% refused mostly because they either wanted or
                  did
	not want to receive antibiotics. Over 25% of the patients who
                  gave
	consent were ambivalent about the benefit of antibiotic
                  therapy.
	Predictably there was no evidence of an association between
                  expectations
	and time to cure in those that gave consent. CONCLUSIONS:
                  Selection
	bias occurs if patients with strong expectations refuse to
                  participate
	in a trial and if the success of the intervention depends in
                  part
	on a patient's expectations. Methods that adjust for selection
                  bias
	are recommended for trials where placebo effects are either of
                  interest
	or could be an important component of an intervention.},

                  patients
	participating in a clinical heart failure trial, particularly
                  in
	relation to whether the trial subsequently proved to be
                  positive,
	negative or neutral. METHODS: Anonymous self-completed
                  questionnaire
	was sent to 78 and returned by 70 consecutive patients 1--6
                  months
	after participating in six clinical heart failure trials. The
                  trial
	was neutral or negative regarding the primary end-point in
                  four (47
	patients) of the six studies (MACH-1 trial of mibefradil,

	of bosentan, CASCO trial of calcium sensitizer, ecadotril
                  trial of
	neutral endopeptidase inhibitor) and positive in two (23
                  patients)
	(ICARUS Israel carvedilol study, exercise study of candesartan
                  cilexetil).
	RESULTS: Most patients reported subjective global clinical
                  benefit
	(78% for positive, 74% for negative or neutral trial, NS)
                  after participating
	in a clinical trial. After adjustment for age, sex, level of
                  education,
	previous research, perceived comprehension, and treatment
                  allocation
	(active drug/placebo) in a stepwise regression model,
                  perceived global
	improvement was greater in older patients (P=0.02), after
                  participation
	in a positive trial (P=0.05) and in females (P=0.07). The
                  major reason
	given by the patient for perceived clinical improvement was
                  better
	follow-up, some believed it was due to change in medication,
                  particularly
	those who had participated in a positive trial. CONCLUSIONS:
                  More
	than 70% of patients participating in clinical trials of new
                  drugs
	for heart failure reported perceived global
                  improvement. Clinical
	improvement was greater in, but not limited to, patients who
                  participated
	in positive trials. These salutary findings support the
                  continued

	The great progress in medicine, also involving the

	One of the most important changes in this field has been the
                  use
	of placebo groups in double-blind controlled studies. The

	Inventory was used to measure anxiety. Injection attribution
                  Ss were

                  related to the
	relatively direct biological effects of an intervention and
                  can be
	elicited by an agent that, by itself, is inert. Understanding
                  these
	placebo effects will help to improve clinical trial design,
                  especially
	for interventions such as surgery, CNS-active drugs and
                  behavioural
	interventions which are often non-blinded. A literature review
                  was
	performed to retrieve articles discussing placebo implications
                  of
	clinical trials, the neurobiology of placebo effects and the
                  implications
	of placebo effect for several disorders of neurological
                  relevance.
	Recent research in placebo analgesia and other conditions has
                  demonstrated
	that several neurotransmitter systems, such as opiate and
                  dopamine,
	are involved with the placebo effect. Brain regions including
                  anterior
	cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal
                  ganglia
	have been activated following administration of placebo. A
                  patients
	expectancy of improvement may influence outcomes as much as
                  some
	active interventions and this effect may be greater for novel
                  interventions
	and for procedures. Maximizing this expectancy effect is
                  important
	for clinicians to optimize the health of their patient. There
                  have
	been many relatively acute placebo studies that are now being
                  extended
	into clinically relevant models of placebo effect. [ABSTRACT
