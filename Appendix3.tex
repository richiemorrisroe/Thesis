\subsection{Instructions}
\label{sec:instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Using the sheet provided, write in the name of a person who fits the category described. The researcher is not interested in this page, and you may take it with you when you are finished
\item  If you cannot think of a person who completely fits the category, use someone who is as close as possible to the role.
\item  Do not re-use people for different roles.
\item Secondly, look at the other sheet. Note the roles along the right hand side of the page
\item  In the gender column, write M if the person you associate with this role is male, and F if this person is female. 
\item  Thirdly, look at the column labeled sort. This tells you which three roles to combine
\item The first sort says 1, 2, 3. These numbers reference the roles. In this case, you are asked to compare a health professional whom you liked, an exercising person and a health professional whom you disliked
\item  In the similarity column, write how two of these figures are similar. In the difference column , write how one of them is different.
\item In the other columns, put an X if the similarity construct applies, and an O if the difference construct applies. Write nothing if the constructs are not relevant
\item Continue down the page until all sorts have been completed. 
\end{enumerate}

Table~\ref{tab:healthrepgrid} shows the sorts that participants were asked to carry out. 
Table~\ref{tab:peoplelist} shows the form in which participants filled out the respective people from their lives (this form was never shared with the researcher).
