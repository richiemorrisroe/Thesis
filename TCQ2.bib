	objectives of this study are to evaluate explanatory beliefs about

	extent to which subjects thought different approaches might be most
	helpful, in a study of botanical treatment. DESIGN: Post hoc analysis
	of data from two similarly randomized controlled clinical trails.
	SETTING: Psychiatric research clinic in an academic medical center.
	SUBJECTS: Fifty-one (51) outpatients participating in two randomized,
	double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of kava in GAD. INTERVENTIONS:
	Kava and placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hamilton Anxiety Scale and
	Global Improvement Scale. RESULTS: Subjects thought their conditions
	were largely related to personality factors, stressful life experiences,
	or cognitive patterns. These beliefs correlated positively with treatment
	response, whereas endorsement of belief in an energy imbalance or
	biologic abnormality correlated negatively with improvement. CONCLUSION:
	Subjects felt more strongly that cognitive patterns, personality
	and stress were causative of their GAD and of greatest relevance
	to recovery. Biologic/genetic factors were somewhat relevant, whereas
	the importance of energy imbalance and spiritual/religious factors
	were minimal. When treating patients, it is important to consider
	the patient's belief systems regarding the disorder, as well as credibility
	of treatment.},

	groups increased significantly compared with that of the pretest,
	2) Source credibility of the Ordinary+Testimonial group was lower
	than the Celebrity+Testimonial, Celebrity+Slice of life, Ordinary+Slice

	OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether Medical Audit Advisory

	systematically by an external agency. METHOD: A postal questionnaire
	was sent to all 105 MAAG chairmen in England and Wales to seek their
	views on the external development of protocols, the inclusion of
	evidence-based prioritized criteria, the general design of the protocols
	issued by the Lilly Audit Centre and the numbers of practices reported
	by MAAGs as making use of at least one of the first four protocols
	issued. RESULTS: Ninety-five MAAGs (90%) responded. Of these, 86%
	were in favour of the external development of protocols, and 98%
	and 94%, respectively, found evidence-based and prioritized criteria
	valuable; 98% felt the overall design and content of the Audit Centre
	protocols were excellent or good. A total of 1018 practices was known
	to have made use of one of these protocols, 261 taking part in multi-practice
	audits organized by their MAAGs. CONCLUSION: Ownership is not necessarily
	more important than scientific credibility and/or perceived utility.
	Externally developed audit protocols containing evidence-based, prioritized
	review criteria are acceptable to MAAGs, which are prepared to recommend
	their use in practice. Accordingly, such systematically developed
	protocols offer a promising and practical method for improving clinical

	were formulated at the start of treatment and assessed at every treatment
	session for credibility during panic attacks and during that session.
	The relation between the belief in CCMs and other measures of panic
	was also studied. Sixty-six patients rated their belief in 1-3 CCMs
	during treatment with cognitive therapy. They also filled in questionnaires
	(ACQ and BSQ) at the start and end of treatment and kept a panic
	diary. RESULTS: The belief in CCMs diminished significantly in the
	course of treatment. A significant correlation between panic frequency
	and belief in CCMs during panic attacks, but not during treatment
	sessions, was found. Relations between improvement in panic frequency,
	ACQ- and BSQ-scores on the one hand and belief in CCMs on the other,

	A video game, "Re-Mission," was developed to actively involve young
	people with cancer in their own treatment. Re-Mission provides opportunities
	to learn about cancer and its treatment. METHOD: The efficacy of
	Re-Mission was investigated in a multi-site, randomized, controlled
	study with 375 adolescent and young adult cancer patients. Participants
	received either a regular commercial game (control) or both the regular
	game plus Re-Mission (Re-Mission group). Participants were given
	a mini-PC with the games installed and requested to play for an hour
	each week for 3 months. A test on cancer-related knowledge was given
	prior to game play (baseline) and again after 1 and 3 months. At
	3 months the Re-Mission group also rated the acceptability and credibility
	of Re-Mission. RESULTS: Analyses of the knowledge test scores showed

	of reports, the new self-assessment instruments offer an excellent
	complement to the more traditional clinical outcome measurements.
	In the absence of a cure for RA and the use of potentially toxic
	drugs, quality-of-life assessment seems to have an important place
	in clinical drug trials. The most commonly used quality of life or
	health status instruments in studies of RA seem to perform well and
	give reliable and valid information. A common concern, however, with
	these instruments is that there appears to be a lack of questionnaires
	which allow satisfaction with various aspects of quality of life
	to be expressed. Many instruments focus on negative aspects of quality
	of life, although quality of life for most individuals is related
	to something positive. There is no perfect instrument applicable
	for all situations, but the selection of an instrument depends on
	the specific purpose of a particular study. Psychological interventions
	are more likely to affect people's emotions and well-being, whereas
	a drug intervention might more dramatically affect physical function.
	It appears, however, reasonable to assume that effects of drug intervention
	on quality of life should be measured with a longer perspective,
	such as after at least 6 months' observation. The field is still
	in a phase of methodological and theoretical development which is
	also reflected in the few numbers of published studies concerning
	the effect of drug interventions on quality of life of patients with

	study based on individual semistructured interviews with 29 participants
	between January and May 2006. These participants were purposefully
	sampled from across four Ministries in the provincial government
	(n = 7), non-government (n = 15), and public health organizations
	(n = 7). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded and analyzed
	using QSR N7 qualitative software. This study received ethics approval
	from The University of Western Ontario Health Research Ethics Board.
	RESULTS: There exists a dissonance between the preference for peer-reviewed,
	unbiased, non-partisan knowledge to support claims and the need for
	fast, "real-time" information on which to base tobacco-related policy
	decisions. Second, there is a great deal of tacit knowledge held

	networks are dynamic, fluid and shifting. CONCLUSION: There exists
	a gap in the production and utilization of research knowledge for
	tobacco control policy. Tacit knowledge held by experts in Ontario
	tobacco control networks is an integral means of managing and evaluating
	research knowledge. Finally, this study builds on Weiss's concept

	of research to enhance one's credibility.},

	predict clinical outcomes in acupuncture for pain. Given existing
	evidence concerning the clinical effectiveness and safety of acupuncture
	in painful conditions, it is important to consider how clinicians
	might further improve their effectiveness. The relevant theoretical
	frameworks focus primarily on the patient, suggesting that their
	background characteristics and their beliefs about pain and acupuncture
	should be considered as potential predictors of outcome. The self-regulation
	model within health psychology helps us understand how people manage
	their health and integrate interventions like acupuncture into the
	management of their illness. This model also implies that the therapeutic
	relationship, in particular patients' perceptions of that relationship,
	is likely to be related to outcome. The empirical literature in this
	area is sparse. However, the findings to date do suggest that a number
	of psychosocial factors, in particular patients' beliefs about acupuncture,
	are significant predictors of treatment outcomes from acupuncture
	for pain. Factors related to the therapeutic relationship are also
	likely to be important in facilitating good clinical outcomes. We
	discuss the limitations of the existing studies and make recommendations
	for future research in this area. If we can better understand the
	psychosocial factors involved in acupuncture, then we should be able
	to enhance acupuncture treatments and improve outcomes for patients.
	These observations will, therefore, have potential to allow us to
	develop techniques that may improve clinical outcomes in the treatment
	of pain.},

	and persuasiveness. METHODS: In a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design
	individuals were shown public service announcements that advocated
	the advantages of sun protection measures in different versions in
	which a picture was present or not present and a textual argument
	was present or not present. The 159 participants were randomly assigned
	to one of four conditions. In each condition, participants were shown
	12 different public service announcements designed according to the
	condition. Participants judged each public service announcement on
	attractiveness, credibility, clarity of communication and the required
	amount of reflection. After the judgment task, they completed a questionnaire
	to assess knowledge, perceived advantages and disadvantages of sun
	protection and intended use of sun protection measures. RESULTS:
	Pictures enhanced attractiveness, but diminished comprehension. Textual

	updating strategies. To test its feasibility and to help physicians
	devise new learning and updating strategies, the knowing-in-action
	model developed by Schon was applied in planning and evaluating an
	interactive workshop. Acquisition of knowledge was tested. METHODS:
	The office and hospital charts of a family physician were reviewed.
	They were used to prepare a longitudinal case study, based on the
	real-life story of a hypertensive patient followed by her doctor
	over a period of 15 years. The clinician's approach to solving clinical
	problems was triangulated for credibility with general practitioners,
	specialists, and the information available in the literature. This
	longitudinal case study was used to develop an interactive educational
	workshop. The workshop was presented to physicians who had registered
	in an accredited continuing medical education event. Changes in pre-
	and postevent knowledge among the participants were assessed using
	touch pad technology to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach
	on the acquisition of knowledge related to management of arterial
	hypertension and associated clinical problems. RESULTS: A comparison
	of pre- and post-test data showed a significant improvement in knowledge
	for participants who answered all questions on both questionnaires
	(n = 8/37). The average score of these participants increased from
	5.5 of 10 before the workshop to 8.3 of 10 after the workshop (p
	< .05). Participants reported a high satisfaction rate for the event.
	FINDINGS: A workshop using the longitudinal case study enables physicians
	to perceive their daily practice through a continuing education activity
	in which they experience the processes of reflection in action and
	reflection on action described by Schon. It also increases awareness
	of the gap between current practice and experts' recommendations
	and provides an opportunity to evaluate the means for bridging or
	closing this gap. It sensitizes the physician to patients' changing
	needs and prompts the clinician to reflect on the who, what, when,
	where, and how of learning.},

	interest, knowledge, and credibility of either an episode of The
	Cosby Show or Family Matters. Both episodes had an anti-alcohol message
	embedded within their plots. RESULTS: Overall, students gave high
	rates of interest and credibility and received high scores for knowledge

	scores, on average, for interest and credibility. White students
	had the highest knowledge scores. Students with different television

	however, students who had previously seen the episodes gave higher

	that youngsters are receptive to antialcohol messages within commercial

	been discussed before, but no comprehensive structured procedure
	leading to risk-adapted quality management has been published so
	far. Such a procedure is of particular interest for noncommercial
	trials in order to optimally use the sparse resources. PURPOSE: To
	provide a structured procedure for risk analysis in clinical trials.
	To propose strategies for on-site monitoring adapted to the risks
	identified. RESULTS: The risk analysis refers to the risk of noncompliance
	with the main objectives of Good Clinical Practice. It takes into
	account risks of the study intervention compared to the risks a patient
	would run if treated outside a protocol as well as further potential
	risks regarding patient safety, patient rights, or the credibility
	of results. The risk analysis is based on detailed questionnaires,
	which are used to draw up (a) an on-site monitoring strategy recommendation,
	(b) a list of trial-specific tasks to be covered by on-site monitoring,
	and (c) a specification of further quality management measures e.g.,
	central monitoring measures. The resulting risk-adapted monitoring
	strategies focus on the trial's critical aspects, and differ in terms
	of the recommended extent of on-site activities. LIMITATIONS: The
	effectiveness of the proposed risk analysis and risk-adapted monitoring
	has not yet been confirmed. However, the ADAMON project (prospective
	cluster-randomised study of trial-specific adapted strategies for
	on-site monitoring in combination with additional quality management
	measures) has been started in Germany to investigate whether a trial-specific,
	risk-adapted, reduced on-site monitoring strategy is as effective
	as an intensive monitoring strategy with regard to the occurrence
	of serious or critical audit findings. Twelve clinical trials planning
	to recruit more than 3200 patients participate in this investigation.
	CONCLUSIONS: Our proposal will provide sponsor-investigators and
	other noncommercial sponsors with an instrument that may facilitate
	risk analysis and the implementation of targeted quality management
	measures.},

	are likely to subsequently develop chronic posttraumatic stress disorder
	(PTSD). Cognitive behavioral therapy for ASD may prevent PTSD, but
	trauma survivors may not tolerate exposure-based therapy in the acute
	phase. There is a need to compare non exposure therapy techniques
	with prolonged exposure for ASD. Objective: To determine the efficacy
	of exposure therapy or trauma-focused cognitive restructuring in
	preventing chronic PTSD relative to a wait-list control group. Design,
	Setting, and Participants: A randomized controlled trial of civilians
	who experienced trauma and who met the diagnostic criteria for ASD
	(N = 90) seen at an outpatient clinic between March 1, 2002, and
	June 30, 2006. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned to receive
	5 weekly 90-minute sessions of either imaginal and in vivo exposure
	(n = 30) or cognitive restructuring (n = 30), or assessment at baseline
	and after 6 weeks (wait list group; n = 30). Main Outcome Measures:
	Measures of PTSD at the 6-month follow-up visit by clinical interview
	and self report assessments of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and trauma-related
	cognition. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that at posttreatment,
	fewer patients in the exposure group had PTSD than those in the cognitive
	restructuring or wait-list groups (33% vs 63% vs 77%; P = .002).
	At follow-up, patients who underwent exposure therapy were more likely
	to not meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD than those who underwent
	cognitive restructuring (37% vs 63%; odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence
	interval, 1.12-3.94; P = .05) and to achieve full remission (47%
	vs 13%; odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-6.83; P =
	.005). On assessments of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, exposure
	resulted in markedly larger effect sizes at posttreatment and follow-up
	than cognitive restructuring. Conclusions: Exposure-based therapy
	leads to greater reduction in subsequent PTSD symptoms in patients
	with ASD when compared with cognitive restructuring. Exposure should
	be used in early intervention for people who are at high risk for
	developing PTSD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights

	of the project, I became enthusiastic about the potential for change,
	progress and increased validation enabled by the audit process. I
	realised the significance and importance of audit as an evaluatory
	tool in relation to complementary and alternative medicine. Still
	in the earlier stages of acceptance by more orthodox medicine, these
	therapies require audit, as much as they require quality scientific
	research. 'Complementary and alternative medical practitioners, teachers
	and researchers need to understand the advantages of more systematic
	audit and rigorous research' (Foundation for Integrated Medicine)
	The objectives of this audit are: To review the performance of the
	massage in day-care after 2 years of activity. To obtain first hand
	feedback from clients, staff and carers with a view to introducing
	improvements. To devise a system of measuring the performance of
	the day-care service both for comparison internally and with other
	external hospices. To benefit from the discipline which the audit
	process itself engenders in complementary medical practice. To lend
	credibility to the massage service and other complementary therapies
	in the context of more orthodox palliative care. To arrive at a method
	of measuring massage as a complementary therapy. To improve communication
	between the different areas of the hospice. I would encourage other
	complementary therapists to follow suit and start auditing to help
	validate the importance of these therapies in today's more holistic

	and administered to 394 women by trained fieldworkers. RESULTS: The
	most frequently encountered source of nutrition information was the
	media, particularly the radio and TV (73.4% and 72.1% of subjects,
	respectively, obtained information from this source in the past year),
	followed by family/friends (64.6%). Despite only 48.5% of subjects

	A 23-item questionnaire was developed, validated and administered
	on the GPs. Eighty-seven GPs responded to the survey (response rate
	26.8%). RESULTS: The majority of the respondents (85.1%) claimed
	that they actively prescribed generic medicines in their practice.
	On the other hand, only 4.6% of the respondents correctly identified
	the Malaysia's National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau's bioequivalence
	standard for generic products. There were misconceptions among the
	respondents about the concepts of "bioequivalence", "efficacy", "safety",
	and "manufacturing standards" of generic medicines. GPs in this survey
	believed that a standard guideline on brand substitution process,
	collaboration with pharmacists, patient education and information
	on safety and efficacy of generic medicines were necessary to ensure
	quality use of generics. Furthermore, advertisements and product
	bonuses offered by pharmaceutical companies, patient's socio-economic

	to influence their choice of medicine. CONCLUSION: Although it appeared

	claims. METHODS: Interviews were used to document the experiences

	experiences in negative terms and found dealing with the workers'
	compensation system frustrating and unpleasant. They encountered
	attitudes that labeled them as malingerers and felt their credibility
	was questioned. CONCLUSIONS: Physical therapists' experiences of
	the workers' compensation system were negative, and they were keen
	to become independent of it. Those who claimed workers' compensation
	perceived that a compensable claim could limit their employment opportunities,
	making confidentiality an important issue when treating other health

	in Rome for the first meeting of an enlarged commission on the topic.
	Other commission members were theologians, philosophers, demographers,
	psychologists, zoologists, economists, bishops, cardinals, and physicians
	who operated rhythm method clinics. Participants were asked not to
	speak with the press, and the couple complied except for mentioning
	that they were housed in separate quarters. This situation was changed
	for subsequent meetings. The couple's job was to prepare a questionnaire
	for married couples asking their opinion of the rhythm method. This
	questionnaire was formatted by the University of Notre Dame sociology
	department and sent to thousands of couples around the world. The
	replies were heart-rending as people related their difficulties with
	the rhythm method and the burdens they faced rearing large families.
	The letters were bound and given to the theologians who met separately
	and then reported that 90% of them felt that birth control was not
	intrinsically evil. The entire commission reviewed the document prepared
	by the theologians, and 90% agreed with it. This document was presented
	to the Pope. The couple heard nothing further about the work of the
	commission until 1968 when a reporter called them in the middle of
	the night asking their opinion of the newly-released Humanae Vitae.

	and to begin to explore the theoretical underpinnings that may influence
	this relationship. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY: A convenience sample of
	29 female registered nurses working in hospice or home health settings
	participated in an educational program 1 day per week for 6 weeks.
	All participants were asked to complete the Cancer Pain Knowledge
	Inventory and Survey of Expectations and Pain Assessment Questionnaire
	5 weeks before, immediately before, immediately after, 6 months after,
	and 12 months after the program. Seventeen participants completed
	all questionnaires at the 6-month follow-up; 16 participants completed
	all questionnaires at the 1-year follow-up. Personal beliefs about
	pain were evaluated in relation to the dimensions and treatment of
	pain. Intentions and expectations to perform specific activities
	were evaluated in relation to in-depth assessments, equianalgesic
	conversions, demonstration of new ideas, and communication. RESULTS:
	Nurses' attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and expectations about pain
	and pain management influenced nurses' patient care and educational
	activities. Nurses who believed that patients should be pain free
	and nurses who focused on both the dimensions and treatment of pain
	implemented more pain management activities. In general, nurses who
	had high intentions and expectations performed more pain management
	activities. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Although nurses reported change
	in attitude, and high expectancy for change, feelings of increased
	credibility, and increased motivation as advocates for new approaches
	to practice, nurses sometimes found it difficult to implement new
	practices because of constraints in time and collaborative efforts.
	To implement new knowledge and achieve individualized goals for change,
	nurses must be allowed adequate time to analyze the relationships
	between their beliefs about pain and the ways that they solve patients'
	pain problems. In addition, more support for multidisciplinary collaboration
	is needed.},

	has conducted 10 focus group discussions among homogeneous groups

	trimester pregnant women. All women in these communities breastfeed

	is universally accepted as the best food for babies, and breastfeeding
	spaces births. Prelacteal feedings of water herbal infusions and
	ritual fluids are the norm, and breastmilk is supplemented, from
	birth, with water and teas. Exclusive breastfeeding is considered
	dangerous to the infant: the baby has an obligatory requirement for
	supplementary water to quench its thirst and promote its normal development,
	and for herbal teas which serve as food and medicine. Colostrum is
	discarded because it is dirty, "like pus", and therefore potentially
	harmful to the infant, although 24% of the survey sample would give
	it to their babies. Expressed breastmilk is suspect as it can get
	contaminated, poisoned or bewitched. Complementary foods are introduced
	as early as two months because of perceived lactation insufficiency.
	The commonest supplement is a watery maize porridge of low nutrient
	density. Breastfeeding can also be dangerous, as toxins and contaminants
	can be passed to the infant through breastmilk. The most serious
	conflict with the WHO/UNICEF recommendations is the lack of local
	credibility of exclusive breastfeeding. According to local knowledge,
	the early introduction of water, herbal teas, and of complementary
	foods is designed to enhance child survival, while these are supposed
	to do the exact opposite by the WHO/UNICEF rationale, by exposing

  abstract = {Purpose. Patient expectancies are known as a common factor contributing
	to psychotherapy outcome. Among expectancies, specific control expectancies
	(such as the perceived responsibility for change) can be considered
	of special clinical interest because of their connection with the
	engagement of patients in therapy. Attempts to study control beliefs
	in relation to psychotherapy outcome have been made by the locus
	of control research but received less attention in recent years.
	Based on findings from the expectancies literature (also including
	outcome and patient role expectancies), this systematic review proposes
	ways to reactivate the promising field of control expectancies in
	the psychotherapy context. Methods. The PsychInfo and PubMed databases
	were searched with the keywords 'expectancies', 'expectations', 'locus
	of control', and 'role expectancies'; these terms were cross-referenced
	with the terms 'patient', 'client', 'psychotherapy', 'treatment',
	and 'outcome'. A total of 35 studies published in the last 25 years
	and focusing on the relationship between patient expectancies and
	psychotherapy outcome were identified and included in this review.
	Results. The review of the literature shows a modest direct relationship
	between specific expectancies and clinical improvement. Studies focusing
	on the association between global expectancies and outcome led to
	rather inconsistent findings. Conclusions. The study of control expectancies
	in psychotherapy has been neglected in the past years probably due
	to mixed results. The main reasons for inconsistency can be found
	in the scarcity of specific assessment measures for treatment expectancies
	as well as in the limited knowledge about process variables in the
	past. Implications for future control expectancies research are discussed,
	and a new rating scale is proposed as a possible tool for measuring
	control expectancies in the specific context of psychotherapy. [ABSTRACT

	can exert a powerful influence on treatment and/or drug effects.
	As patients participate in more complementary and/or alternative
	treatments for psychiatric conditions, it is important to assess
	the role of belief or expectancy on response to nontraditional treatment
	approaches. The Acupuncture Beliefs Scale was developed to assess
	belief in the efficacy of acupuncture for both physical and psychiatric
	symptoms and conditions. Development and psychometric properties
	of the scale are described. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Research personnel
	solicited statements regarding the potential experience and effects
	of acupuncture. These items were collapsed into a set of 36 items,
	with some rotated to avoid response bias. Outpatients diagnosed with
	bipolar disorder and undergraduates completed the scale (n = 118).
	RESULTS: The scale yielded excellent internal consistency (coefficient
	alpha = 0.97), and item-total score correlations between 0.37 and
	0.83. Principal component analysis with a varimax rotation revealed
	three significant and meaningful factors that were consistent across
	both subject groups. Factors appeared to capture general endorsement
	of acupuncture treatment, beliefs in the scientific value and credibility
	of acupuncture treatment, and beliefs about the procedures and physical
	experience of acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: The Acupuncture Beliefs Scale
	is a 36-item self-report scale that may be useful for measurement
	of beliefs in the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment.},

	was completed by 321 patients. Factor analysis revealed three scales,
	each assessing the characteristic of one stage of readiness to change,
	the Precontemplation, Contemplation and Action scale. Firstly, the
	reliabilities of these scales were 0.61, 0.86 and 0.61, respectively,
	and only the latter two scales correlated significantly (r = 0.14).
	Secondly, the scales were validated using subscales from the Multidimensional
	Pain Inventory, beliefs on the credibility of the self-management
	approach and subscales from the Illness Perception Questionnaire.
	These subscales explained 5, 22 and 8% of the variance of the scores
	on the Precontemplation, Contemplation and the Action scales, respectively.
	Thirdly, on the basis of the three scale scores, over 80% of the
	fibromialgia patients could be classified into one of five potentially
	psychological relevant subgroups: Precontemplation, Contemplation,
	Preparation, Action and Relapse. The data suggest that improvements
	in operationalizations of the Precontemplation and Action dimensions
	of readiness to change are needed and that the theoretical foundation
	of readiness to change needs further development. (C) 2001 International

	METHODS: Data stem from a survey conducted in 2005 in 1094 subjects
	>or=60 y of age from a large sample of 100 institutions of the Rhone-Alpes
	region of France. A Bayesian approach was used to quantify the effect
	of tooth deterioration on malnutrition through a two-level logistic
	regression. This approach allowed taking into account the uncertainty
	on sensitivity and specificity of the Mini Nutritional Assessment
	questionnaire to adjust for the measurement error of that test. RESULTS:
	After adjustment for other risk factors, the risk of malnutrition
	increased significantly and continuously 1.15 times (odds ratio 1.15,
	95% credibility interval 1.06-1.25) whenever the masticatory percentage
	decreased by 10 points, which is equivalent to the loss of two molars.
	The strongest factors that augmented the probability of malnutrition
	were deglutition disorders, depression, and verbal inconsistency.
	Dependency was also an important factor; the odds of malnutrition
	nearly doubled for each additional grade of dependency (graded 6
	to 1). Diabetes, central neurodegenerative disease, and carcinoma
	tended to increase the probability of malnutrition but their effect
	was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Dental status should
	be considered a serious risk factor for malnutrition. Regular dental
	examination and care should preserve functional dental integrity
	to prevent malnutrition in institutionalized elderly people.},

	A surgical technique questionnaire was administered at two times

	or placebo acupuncture, patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire
	on credibility. In addition, after 3 or 4 treatments, patients were
	asked for the feeling of needle insertion and deqi. RESULTS: No difference
	between real and placebo acupuncture was detected with respect to
	the credibility of the treatment (p > 0.05). Needle insertion was
	recognised in all patients in the real acupuncture group and in all

	Purpose: In spite of the increasing acceptance of acupuncture, including
	in physical medicine, there is a lack of controlled efficacy studies
	for this procedure. The obvious problem in acupuncture studies, as
	in all physical methods of treatment, is the choice of the control
	treatment. We therefore present the first clinical study of the efficacy
	of symptom-specific acupuncture in patients with coxarthrosis, coupled
	with an examination of the usefulness of a new control acupuncture.
	Material, Methods: Prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind
	study. 67 patients were enrolled in the study, split into two treatment
	groups and treated 9 times during 3 weeks. The acupuncture treatment
	was according to the recommendations of traditional Chinese acupuncture.
	A modified minimal acupuncture, as described by Vincent, was used
	as the control treatment. The outcome variables were intensity of
	pain (VAS), Hip Function Index (Lequesne), over-all assessment (Carlsson)
	and a modified expectancy scale (Borkovec). Results: 1. The acceptance
	of the new control acupuncture and of the traditional acupuncture
	was similar, with both aimed 5.2 +/- 1.7 points according to the
	questionnaire. 2. For both treatments there was a significant improvement
	of symptoms on follow-up. The mean reduction in pain was 27% and
	the hip function index improved by 18%. There were no significant
	differences between the two treatments. Conclusion: 1. The acceptance
	and credibility of control acupuncture is similar to that of genuine
	acupuncture. 2. The results of the study indicate that the efficacy
	in coxarthrosis of symptom-specific acupuncture is comparable to
	that of segmental stimulation with acupuncture needles (control acupuncture)

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute herpes zoster is a prevalent condition. One of its
	major symptoms is pain, which can highly influence patient's quality
	of life. Pain therapy is limited. Acupuncture is supposed to soften
	neuropathic pain conditions and might therefore act as a therapeutic
	alternative. Objective of the present study is to investigate whether
	a 4 week semi-standardised acupuncture is non-inferior to sham laser
	acupuncture and the anticonvulsive drug gabapentine in the treatment
	of pain associated with herpes zoster. METHODS/DESIGN: Three-armed,
	randomised, placebo-controlled trial with a total follow-up time
	of 6 months. Up to estimated 336 patients (interim analyses) with
	acute herpes zoster pain (VAS > 30 mm) will be randomised to one
	of three groups (a) semi-standardised acupuncture (168 patients);
	(b) gabapentine with individualised dosage between 900-3600 mg/d
	(84 patients); (c) sham laser acupuncture. Intervention takes place
	over 4 weeks, all patients will receive analgesic therapy (non-opioid
	analgesics: metamizol or paracetamol and opioids: tramadol or morphine).
	Therapy phase includes 4 weeks in which group (a) and (c) consist
	of 12 sessions per patient, (b) visits depend on patients needs.
	Main outcome measure is to assess the alteration of pain intensity
	before and 1 week after treatment sessions (visual analogue scale
	VAS 0-100 mm). Secondary outcome measure are: alteration of pain
	intensity and frequency of pain attacks; alteration of different
	aspects of pain evaluated by standardised pain questionnaires (NPI,
	PDI, SES); effects on quality of life (SF 36); analgesic demand;
	alteration of sensoric perception by systematic quantitative sensory
	testing (QST); incidence of postherpetic neuralgia; side effects
	and cost effectiveness. Credibility of treatments will be assessed.
	DISCUSSION: This study is the first large-scale randomised placebo
	controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture compared
	to gabapentine and sham treatment and will provide valuable new information
	about the clinical and physiological effects of acupuncture and gabapentine
	in the treatment of acute herpes zoster pain. The study has been
	pragmatically designed to ensure that the study findings can be implemented
	into clinical practice if acupuncture can be shown to be an effective

	reports of a sore throat associated with pain on swallowing. This
	study was established to examine the immediate pain alleviating effect
	of a single point acupuncture treatment applied to the large intestine
	meridian of patients with sore throat. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty
	patients with acute tonsillitis and pharyngitis were enrolled in
	this randomized placebo-controlled trial. They either received acupuncture,
	or sham laser acupuncture, directed to the large intestine meridian
	section between acupuncture points LI 8 and LI 10. The main outcome
	measure was the change of pain intensity on swallowing a sip of water
	evaluated by a visual analog scale 15 minutes after treatment. A
	credibility assessment regarding the respective treatment was performed.
	RESULTS: The pain intensity for the acupuncture group before and
	immediately after therapy was 5.6+/-2.8 and 3.0+/-3.0, and for the
	sham group 5.6+/-2.5 and 3.8+/-2.5, respectively. Despite the articulation
	of a more pronounced improvement among the acupuncture group, there
	was no significant difference between groups (Delta=0.9, confidence
	interval: -0.2-2.0; P=0.12; analysis of covariance). Patients' satisfaction
	was high in both treatment groups. The study was prematurely terminated
	due to a subsequent lack of suitable patients. DISCUSSION: A single
	acupuncture treatment applied to a selected area of the large intestine
	meridian was no more effective in the alleviation of pain associated
	with clinical sore throat than sham laser acupuncture applied to
	the same area. Hence, clinically relevant improvement could be achieved.
	Pain alleviation might partly be due to the intense palpation of
	the large intestine meridian. The benefit of a comprehensive acupuncture
	treatment protocol in this condition should be subject to further
	trials.},

	characteristics of print education materials that healthcare providers
	report as important to patients; compare whether Physician Data Query
	(PDQ) information that was provided in its original form, or was
	redesigned in color and black and white, influenced the distribution
	of this information; and explore whether providing PDQ information
	via patient information racks would increase patients' awareness
	of and use of PDQ information. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY: Forty-four oncology
	healthcare professionals were asked to complete a survey identifying
	characteristics that they believed important for effective print
	educational materials. PDQ statements were reformatted and placed
	in brochure racks for a 6-month period. The number of statements
	distributed before and after this time period were compared. Subsequently,
	PDQ statements were placed sequentially for a 3-week period in brochure
	racks in the following formats: original form as printed from the
	computer, redesigned with color print; and redesigned with black
	ink only. RESULTS: The following characteristics were rated "very
	important" aspects of print educational materials by oncology healthcare
	professionals: appropriate reading level; clarity; credibility of
	the information; whether information is current/up-to-date; and patient
	acceptance of material. The characteristic receiving the fewest "very
	important" marks was attractiveness/eye appeal. The reported low
	marks on attractiveness/eye appeal contradict the concurrent findings
	that, after the redesign of PDQ statements (change in booklet size,
	use of color, increase in foot size for text and headings, and inclusion
	of a vertical bar to separate columns), there was a ninefold increase
	in the number PDQ statements distributed. Eighty-nine percent of
	the statements distributed were the redesigned version. The use of
	color, however, did not appear to make a difference in the number
	of PDQ statements disseminated after the redesign. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
	In developing print education materials for cancer patients, the
	format, design, and placement of materials for patient access need
	to be considered. There are many valuable educational materials available
	on computer databases. Downloading the information and placing it
	in a brochure format may be an ideal approach for providing access
	to this information. Furthermore, because physicians and nurses have
	different priorities for printed patient education materials, it
	is important to involve both groups in the developments of the brochures.},

	plays a major role. In order to measure this construct, usually rather
	general, bipolar rating scales are applied. However, these scales
	are often susceptible to social desirability biases. PATIENTS-METHODS:
	Coloproctological patients were asked to complete a questionnaire
	with ratings of satisfaction and anxiety at two different points
	of measurement: One group while in treatment (N = 86) and a second
	group approximately 1 year after their treatment (N = 328). RESULTS:
	Even when controlling for relevant demographic influences, a clear
	decrease in intensity of the evaluation ratings is shown when the
	survey was administered 1 year after release from hospital as compared
	to during the patients' stay in hospital. For generally formulated
	scales of patient satisfaction, social desirability constitutes a
	significant bias. CONCLUSION: The usual conceptualization of a bipolar
	continuum of patient satisfaction or dissatisfaction must be renounced.
	Instead, questionnaires might be constructed in three steps which
	investigate problem dimensions at a medium level of concreteness.
	Only in this way can quality management gain credibility and trust
	within as well as beyond the field of medicine.},

	A questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 500 GPs, who were
	asked about their level of knowledge and frequency of use of IRF's
	activities, as well as their opinion on the relevance, credibility
	and independence of the IRF's activities. RESULTS: The response rate
	was 59%. IRF is generally not the first source of information about
	new drugs, but is frequently used in the search for information about
	comparability between drugs and in relation to sudden drug warnings.
	IRF's Rational Pharmacotherapy bulletin and its GP courses, which
	nine out of ten GPs knew about, were considered to be highly relevant
	by 80% and 71%, respectively. All of IRF's activities were considered
	highly credible. Most GPs felt that the IRF's information increased

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health information reaching the public today is often
	characterized by what decision theorists have termed 'ambiguity'-
	i.e. uncertainty regarding the information's reliability, credibility
	or adequacy. This is a critical problem, as growing research suggests
	that ambiguity has important effects-promoting pessimistic judgments
	about risks and potential outcomes of risk-reducing behaviours, and
	lowering adoption of these behaviours. However, little is known about
	the public's perceptions of ambiguity in the health information domain,
	the effects of these perceptions, and the factors that influence
	these effects. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between perceived
	ambiguity regarding cancer prevention recommendations and prevention-related
	perceptions and behaviours, and to explore how these associations
	differ by cancer type. STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional
	analysis of data on 4,070 adults participating in the 2005 US Health
	Information National Trends Survey. MAIN VARIABLES AND OUTCOME MEASURES:
	We examined associations between perceived ambiguity about colon,
	skin and lung cancer prevention recommendations and two main outcome
	variables: (i) risk-related cognitions (perceived cancer risk and
	preventability, cancer-related worry) and (ii) risk-modifying behaviours
	(colon cancer screening, sunscreen use and smoking abstinence). RESULTS:
	Perceived ambiguity was inversely associated with perceptions of
	the preventability of all three cancers, and with cancer-specific
	risk-modifying behaviours including sigmoidoscopy-colonoscopy testing,
	sunscreen use and smoking abstinence. Relationships with cancer risk
	perceptions and worry varied across different cancer types. CONCLUSIONS:
	Perceived ambiguity about cancer prevention recommendations has significant
	and predictable associations with cancer prevention-related cognitions
	and behaviours, and some associations differ by cancer type. These
	findings have implications for future research and communication
	efforts.},

	in carers' approach after the intervention. METHODS: Several data
	collections were conducted across the intervention and consisted
	of nursing documentation, patient life stories as told by carers,
	video recorded interactions, stimulated recall interviews and a questionnaire.
	Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the analyses.
	FINDINGS: The findings from the different methods mirrored each other
	and added to the credibility of the intervention. Communicated knowledge
	about patients improved in nursing documentation and also as told
	by carers. Carers were differently skilled in managing the complexity
	of nursing care situations before as well as after the intervention,
	but the intervention contributed to developing carers in 'confirming
	nursing care'. They also improved in their ability to verbalize reflections
	about their everyday life with patients with dementia. CONCLUSION:
	Supervision made it possible for carers to share their lived experiences
	about their day-to-day life with patients, which could promote personal
	and professional development and thus improve care quality. It also
	appeared that a detailed assessment tool used as part of the nursing

	condition indicating greater disagreement than control participants
	(F = 3.05, 2/701 df, p < .05). Belief in myths about the etiology

	The program's ability to influence behavior was hindered by systemic
	problems, such as trainer credibility and implementation infidelity,
	and probable participant psychological reactance. Training by professionals

	this study timely. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the
	role of the community palliative care CNS as educator. METHOD: Hermeneutic
	phenomenology, using semi-structured interviews with a convenience
	sample of eight community palliative care CNSs was the approach used.
	Formal ethical approval was obtained and all participants provided
	written informed consent. Colaizzi's framework for analysis provided
	a structured and transparent approach to data analysis. A summary
	of the findings were verified by the participants to enhance the
	credibility of interpretation presented here. RESULTS: Data analysis
	identified three main themes; conflict of expectations, credibility
	as a teacher and making the education role work. This study highlighted
	a team approach may address the conflict of expectations between
	the role specifications and practice reality. CONCLUSION: The CNS
	has a role in education. However for some CNSs, providing informal
	education rather than formal education may be appropriate. If the
	community palliative care CNS provides formal education, they require
	the knowledge and skills to deliver it effectively. The role of the
	CNS in palliative care education in the community should respond
	to personal, professional and local needs.},

  abstract = {The numerous researches proved a thesis of the connection between
	the erectile dysfunction (ED) and atherosclerosis risk factors. The
	special part among the risk factors plays the low physical activity,
	which, due to rapid development of civilization, makes a serious
	problem concerning mainly the well-developed countries. THE AIM OF
	THE STUDY: Bearing in mind the fact of the physical activity influence
	on physical capacity and ED intensity, was an analysis of ED intensity
	in the population of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and
	the evaluation of the relations connecting quality of erection with
	physical activity and physical capacity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The
	analysis concerned 207 men with IHD at the age of 61-71 years (the
	mean: 66.77 +/- 2.63 years), treated invasively (163--PTCA, 44--CABG).
	All the men were professionally inactive for 3.23 +/- 2.12 years.
	All of them were in the relationships with the same partner for many
	years. The inclusion criteria were: a correctly filled questionnaire
	IIEF-5 (all categories), a Framingham questionnaire and ECG treadmill
	test assessed as a negative one. RESULTS: The erectile dysfunction
	was recognized when in the questionnaire IIEF-5 the total number
	of points was < or =21. A parameter of an exercise test subjected
	to evaluation was the value of metabolic equivalent (MET) and analyzed
	parameter from the Framingham questionnaire was activity intensity
	in free from work time (MET/h). In the analyzed group of 207 patients
	with IHD, the erectile dysfunction showed 71.5% of the population.
	The average value obtained for the examined IHD patients from the
	IIEF-5 questionnaire was 14.05 +/- 7.40. Taking into account the
	number of obtained in the questionnaire points, the patients with
	ED were divided into four categories: severe--29.5% of the whole
	group, medium-severe--8.2% of population, medium--20.8% of population
	and moderate--13% of the IHD population. The effort test and the
	analysis of Framingham questionnaire revealed information about physical
	capacity and physical activity of particular patients with IHD. The
	analysis of dependence between physical capacity and quality of erection
	conducted for the group of patients with IHD showed the lack of statistically
	significant correlation between these parameters (Pearson's correlation
	coefficient r = 0.013). The analysis of dependence between physical
	activity and quality of erection showed statistically significant
	correlation between these parameters (Pearson's correlation coefficient
	r = 0.781). Considering the dependence of results on the credibility
	of data from the IIEF-5 chart, the last element was the analysis
	of 'truthfulness test', which did not show any statistically significant
	difference between the results from the first and the next questionnaire.
	CONCLUSIONS: High everyday physical activity is significantly connected
	with the decreasing erectile dysfunction intensity and its evaluation
	may be a simple method allowing preliminary qualification of the
	patient to the group being at higher risk. The physical capacity
	presented by the patients with IHD is not significantly associated
	with quality of erection.},

	interventions completing repairing actions and pharmacotherapy. Addressing
	various preventive programs to the patients with CVD, we put a special

	which has a beneficial influence on the circulatory system. As it
	has been proved, protective action of physical activity on the vessels
	concerns the whole arterial system including the vessels responsible
	for erectile dysfunction (ED) creation. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: The
	analysis of the influence of physical activity modification, taking
	place within frames of a six-month supervised cardiac rehabilitation,
	on ED intensification in the population with ischemic heart disease
	(IHD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis has been conducted on 129
	patients with IHD, whose preliminary test IIEF-5 (International Index
	of Erectile Function-5) showed < or =21 scores, which justified ED
	diagnosis. The analyzed group consisted of 98 patients with IHD at
	the mean age of 62.35 +/- 8.88 years, who were subjected to the six-month
	cardiologic rehabilitation. The testing group comprises 31 patients
	with IHD at the mean age of 61.71 +/- 7.35, who were not rehabilitated
	for objective reasons. The patients of both groups filled in an IIEF-5
	questionnaire twice, at the interval of six months. RESULTS: As a
	result of cardiologic rehabilitation in the analyzed group, a statistically
	significant increase in scores occurred in the IIEF5 test, from 11.88
	+/- 6.2 to 13.69 +/- 7.07, which was not observed in the control
	group. Moreover, a division of the analyzed group into ED intensity
	categories (severe, medium-severe, moderate, light) confirmed the
	occurrence of significant changes of ED intensity for subsequent
	ED severity categories. For the subsequent ED intensity categories,
	from the greatest to the lightest, the statistically significant
	increase of the scores from a sheet IIEF-5: 4.66 +/- 0.98 vs. 5.34

	+/- 1.23 (p < 0.01) has been found. Bearing in mind the dependence
	of results on the credibility of data from the sheet IIEF-5, the
	last element was the analysis of 'truthfulness test', which has not
	shown any statistically significant differences obtained for first
	and next filling in the questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: The performed
	analyses allowed drawing the conclusions. A six-month cardiac rehabilitation
	cycle led to a significant positive modification of erectile dysfunction
	intensity. The greatest positive ED modification occurred at the
	groups of the patients, in whom the erectile dysfunction intensity

	To assess the feasibility of a general practice-based clinical trial

	Recruitment target was 30 patients. Eligibility was confirmed by
	a consultant psychiatrist using standard criteria (DSM-IV) and instruments
	Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Suicidal and psychotic patients
	were excluded, additional precautions against suicide were incorporated.
	There was a 1 week run-in period and patients showing spontaneous
	improvement were excluded. Homeopathic treatment was prescribed by
	a GP qualified in homeopathy, from a 'limited list' of 30 homeopathic
	medicines, with the help of decision support software. Patients were
	randomised to receive verum Fluoxetine and placebo homeopathy, or
	verum homeopathy and placebo Fluoxetine, or placebo homeopathy and
	placebo Fluoxetine. Treatment duration was 12 weeks. The outcomes
	were: adverse drug reactions, clinical global impression (CGI); HAMD;
	mini international psychiatric Interview; Pittsburgh sleep quality

	Questionnaire (RMDQ), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), medication use
	and an exit questionnaire were completed at baseline, end of treatment,
	and at 3 months follow up. Results: Ninety-four percent (45/48) of

	difference between groups on the RMDQ over time. For pain, the only
	statistically significant difference was at the 3 months follow up
	(worst VAS, point estimate, 18.7, 95% CI 1.5-36.0, p=0.034). The
	majority of patients were taking some form of analgesic medication
	for LBP at the start of treatment (n=44; 92%), and at the end of
	treatment the verum acupuncture group were taking significantly fewer
	tablets of pain control medication (mean (S.D.): 1.0+/-0.3) than
	the placebo group (mean (S.D.): 4.2+/-0.6, p<0.05). Based upon these
	data, power analysis (power=90%, alpha=0.05, minimal clinically important
	difference (MCID) for RMDQ=2.5 points) indicated that 120 participants
	(60 per group) would be needed to complete an adequately powered
	randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated
	the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of penetrating needle
	acupuncture compared to a non-penetrating sham for the treatment
	of acute LBP in primary care; 120 participants would be required
	in a fully powered trial. The placebo needle used in this study proved
	to be a credible form of control.},

	received. 32 healthy volunteers (15 men, 17 women, aged between 20

	de la Republica, Uruguay. Interventions Participants were randomly
	assigned to one of two groups: (1) real acupuncture or (2) sham acupuncture.
	After 30 min, the patients were 'needled' again in a crossover design.
	Main outcome measures A yes/no questionnaire was used to assess the
	credibility and characteristics of the procedure. RESULTS: For the
	credibility question (do you think you received real acupuncture?)
	no statistically significant group differences were evident before
	or after the crossover. Subjects who answered yes to this question
	ranged from 14/16 (87.5%) before crossover to 10/16 (62.5%) after
	crossover for the sham and 12/16 (75%) before crossover to 15/16

	showed a significant difference (only after crossover) was the question,
	"did you feel the needle penetrating the skin?"; after crossover
	12/16 (75%) subjects in the real acupuncture group said yes and 2/16
	(12%) subjects in the sham group said yes to this question (p<0.01).
	CONCLUSIONS: These data suggests that this method is credible and
	constitutes a simple and inexpensive technique for use as a control

	using a mechanical simulator. SETTING: Hands-on ERCP practice workshops.
	SUBJECTS: Endoscopists at various levels of ERCP experience. METHOD:
	Validation studies are described to show that the simulator permits
	participants with varying ERCP experience to demonstrate their skill
	levels and offers novel training applications in ERCP courses. The
	time required for completing a simulated stent placement procedure,
	simulated fluoroscopy time, and participant expectations were recorded

	and after training to determine whether the simulator was a credible
	adjunct to ERCP training. RESULTS: Significantly shorter procedure
	times were recorded for the same accessories used by participants
	with more ERCP experience than those with less experience and for
	the same group of participants when using accessories with 1 design

	measured during practice can complement assessment of trainee competence
	or define usefulness of different accessories is unknown but deserves
	to be explored in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure times
	can categorize participants according to their ERCP experience and
	separate accessories according to their ease of use. An increase

	Questionnaire (HCAMQ) assessing attitudes to CAM and health beliefs.
	RESULTS: Ten (10) volunteers (5 male and 5 female) were entered and

	standard in biomedical research for determining treatment efficacy
	is the randomized controlled trial (RCT). In pharmaceutical trials,
	inert placebos are an easily administered control that facilitates
	blinded comparisons. In clinical trials that study the effects of
	manual interventions, researchers must carefully consider their use
	of treatment control models. Choosing credible controls that will
	minimize bias in osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) clinical
	trials poses unique challenges to researchers because of heterogeneous
	OMT methods and practice. OBJECTIVE: To compare the treatment credibility
	of sham manipulative treatment and untreated controls to active OMT.
	METHODS: Subjects recruited for an OMT clinical trial for chronic
	low back pain completed a treatment-credibility rating scale comparing
	two written descriptions of the study interventions offered. The
	scale was administered to subjects before trial entry and at 6-month
	follow-up. Scale scores were used to compute credibility ratios for
	both intervention protocols (ie, OMT vs sham manipulative treatment).
	Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess changes
	in the credibility ratio over time, including the measurement of
	study group and time main effects, as well as study group x time
	interaction effects. RESULTS: Subjects (N=91) perceived OMT as a
	more credible therapeutic option than sham manipulative treatment
	both at trial entry and at 6-month follow-up (P<.05). Among subjects
	completing the study protocol (n=66), there were no changes in perceived
	credibility of the study interventions over time. There were no significant
	differences in the credibility ratio among study groups (P=.64) or
	over time (P=.79). In addition, there were no significant study group
	x time interactions (P=.59). CONCLUSIONS: In clinical trials, OMT
	may be perceived by subjects as a more credible treatment alternative
	than many control procedures. Treatment credibility can interact
	with subject expectations and study design in complex ways. When
	analyzing the treatment effects of OMT, investigators must consider
	the effects of these two subjective elements when competing interventions
	are offered and subjects are asked to self-report data. Study design
	should be optimized to equalize these effects among interventions.},

  abstract = {Numerous, but heterogeneous studies have been performed about premenstrual
	syndrome, with finally a lack of credibility and interest among practitioners.
	More recently with the diagnosis criteria generalization, psychiatrists
	were more concerned about this syndrome, because of anxiety and mood
	symptoms involved in social impairment and need of medical care.
	In 1983 in the United States, the National Institute of Mental Health
	conference devoted to this topic proposed the first diagnosis criteria,
	requiring a prospective and daily assessment of the symptoms. In
	1987, the American Psychiatric Association, in the DSM III-R, introduced
	the Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder diagnosis that became in
	1994 in the DSM IV the Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, with the
	same diagnosis criteria. In the literature, prevalence rates are
	very heterogeneous according to the diagnosis criteria used and to
	the populations studied. One of the most relevant criteria is the
	induced impairment, such as avoidance of social activities, or search
	for medical care. Lifetime prevalence is thus estimated between 75
	and 85% if considering the report of one or several symptoms, between
	10 and 15% in case of medical care request, and between 2 and 5%
	in case of social activities interruption. To distinguish isolated
	complaints from a disabling disorder, self-questionnaires are the
	best way of assessment in a so complex and changing disease. Most
	of the epidemiological studies found a positive correlation between
	the premenstrual dysphoric symptoms and the lifetime major depressive
	disorder diagnosis. However, recent prospective studies failed to
	find an association between premenstrual syndrome and an increased
	risk of major depression. On the other hand, some studies showed
	that the premenstrual period is a risk period for associated psychiatric
	disorders exacerbations, as the obsessive-compulsive disorder, more
	severe alcohol intakes in case of alcoholism, symptoms increase in
	schizophrenics, or higher rates of suicide attempts. The most widely
	studied and frequently blamed etiopathogenic hypothesis is the serotonin
	dysregulation. Serotonin is particularly involved in expression of
	irritability and anger, but also in occurrence of depressive symptoms
	and specific food cravings, precisely found in the premenstrual dysphoric
	disorder. Among their different effects, estrogens increase the density
	of serotonin receptors and enhance the sensitivity to serotonin agonists.
	Moreover, some studies found a significantly different response to
	d-fenfluramine, a serotonin agonist, in women with premenstrual dysphoric
	disorder. In psychoanalytical theories the premenstrual syndrome
	was associated to a "femininity complex", to an ambivalent pregnancy
	desire, and to unconscious conflicts relating to sexual preference.
	In this context, Karen Horney, who took a great interest in the premenstrual
	period, was radically opposed to the Freudian theory of feminine
	sexuality, in particular the negation of the female sex. For Karen
	Homey, the "desire of penis" is more expressive of the woman's spite
	not to share the sexual, but also political, social and cultural
	benefits fallen to men. To understand the premenstrual period feelings
	it is also necessary to take into account the personal history of
	the woman and the psychosocial factors involved, as the social and
	cultural beliefs, and the mother-daughter communication. Medical
	cares are necessary when symptoms constitute a severe and disabling
	disorder. Among non-psychiatric treatments, progesterone was the
	most widely prescribed treatment, but relating to recent performed
	studies, it failed to prove its efficiency in such an indication.
	In the same way, the efficiency of the contraceptive pill was not
	demonstrated. The most prescribed psychiatric treatments are serotonin
	re-uptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines. First studies showing serotonin
	re-uptake inhibitors efficiency in premenstrual dysphoric disorder
	were performed in the beginning of the nineties, with clomipramine
	and fluoxetine, and later fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline and
	citalopram. Studies having compared the efficiency of antidepressants
	according to their serotonin activity (paroxetine or sertraline versus
	maprotiline, that is a selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor),
	showed that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors were significantly more
	efficient on all symptoms than maprotiline, that was not more efficient
	than placebo. Low doses of clomipramine (10 to 50 mg per day) seem
	to be sufficient and it appears also preferable to prescribe an intermittent
	treatment because of a possible tolerance effect, susceptible to
	be warned by phases free of treatment. Alprazolam was the most studied
	benzodiazepine in this indication. Most studies were positive, using
	daily posologies of 0.25 to 4 mg during the 6 days preceding the
	menses, with improvement of irritability, anxiety and depressive
	mood. The general practitioner frequently carries out psychological
	support, in particular in case of mild symptoms without consequences.
	Nevertheless, underestimate a more severe psychological suffering
	is a risk, firstly because there is no systematic interrelationship
	between the somatic symptoms intensity and the psychological distress,
	and secondly because premenstrual period is a special emotionally
	moment to put in evidence psychological or relational disruption.
	All kinds of psychotherapy can be relevant, even though the training
	of relaxation techniques is particularly suitable in such an indication.
	In conclusion, and in spite of the generalization of the diagnosis
	criteria in the international psychiatric classifications as the
	DSM, the premenstrual syndrome remains a complex and polymorphous
	disorder. The premenstrual syndrome was considered for a long time
	like a somatic disease, but now the psychiatric symptoms severity
	justifies most often the medical cares. In order to distinguish some
	isolated and mild complaints, of a disabling disorder, the standardized
	prospective auto-assessment is the most relevant method. Finally,
	intermittent prescription of serotonin re-uptake inhibitors appears
	to be the most effective treatment, the previously used hormonal
	treatments not having made proof of their efficiency in such an indication.},

	in the NICE guidelines for the treatment of anxiety and depression.
	However, little is known about who benefits from self-help and the
	potential drawbacks and problems of using this approach. AIMS: To
	address the current gap in knowledge, we contacted accredited BABCP
	practitioners to examine practitioner use and attitudes to self-help,
	current trends of use, and to identify possible problems with this
	therapy. METHOD: A 50% random sample of all accredited BABCP practitioners
	was approached, and the overall response rate for the survey was
	57.6%. RESULTS: Self-help materials were seen positively by therapists
	and were used by 99.6%, mainly as an adjunct to individual therapy.
	Only 38.2% had been trained in the use of self-help, with those trained
	being more likely to recommend self-help. Higher levels of patient
	motivation, credibility, likely adherence, self-efficacy and a lower
	degree of hopelessness were the five factors identified by more than
	70% of respondents as predicting successful patient outcome with
	self-help. Non-compliance and a lack of detection of a worsening
	of the patient's clinical state due to reduced therapist contact
	were viewed as being the most important problems with self-help by
	more than 70% of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Preferable patient characteristics
	for self-help have been identified, as have potential problems and
	adverse consequences.},

	DESIGN: A cross-sectional, self-administered survey of HCWs, augmented
	with focus groups to further examine attitudes toward influenza vaccination.
	SETTING: Two long-term-care facilities participated in the survey.
	The focus groups were held at one of the two facilities. PARTICIPANTS:
	All HCWs were invited to participate in the survey and all nonmanagerial
	staff members were invited to participate in the focus groups. The
	response rate for the survey was 58% (231 of 401). RESULTS: Vaccinated
	HCWs had a more positive attitude toward influenza vaccination and
	a greater belief that the vaccine is effective. This was not accompanied
	by differences in vaccine knowledge or values of potential preventive
	outcomes. Nonvaccinated respondents were more likely to believe that
	other preventive measures, such as washing hands, taking vitamins
	and supplements, eating a nutritious diet, exercising, and taking

	vaccination. Additional findings from the focus groups suggest that

	burden of responsibility of the staff. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies
	challenges to and opportunities for improving vaccination rates among
	HCWs. A message that emphasizes the health benefits of vaccination
	to staff members, such as including vaccination as part of a staff
	"wellness" program, may improve the credibility of influenza immunization

	are an important mechanism of popular psychological interventions
	for pain. However, there has been no research on whether response
	expectancies and treatment credibility independently mediate hypnotic
	and cognitive-behavioral pain interventions and whether the pattern
	of mediation is affected by experience with the interventions. Also,
	past research has indicated that hypnotic pain interventions may
	be moderated by hypnotic suggestibility. However, these studies have
	typically failed to measure the full range of suggestibility and
	have assessed pain reduction and suggestibility in the same experimental
	context, possibly inflating the association between these variables.
	Purpose: To clarify the mediator role of response expectancies and
	treatment credibility, and the moderator role of hypnotic suggestibility
	in the hypnotic and cognitive-behavioral reduction of pain. Methods:
	Approximately 300 participants were assessed for suggestibility.
	Then, as part of an apparently unrelated experiment, 124 of these
	individuals received analogue cognitive-behavioral, hypnotic, or
	placebo control pain interventions. Results: Response expectancies
	and credibility independently mediated treatment. The extent of mediation
	increased as participants gained more experience with the interventions.
	Suggestibility moderated treatment and was associated with relief
	only from the hypnotic intervention. Conclusions: Response expectancies
	and treatment credibility are unique mechanisms of hypnotic and cognitive-behavioral
	pain interventions. Hypnotic suggestibility predicts relief from
	hypnotic pain interventions and this association is not simply an
	artifact of measuring suggestibility and pain reduction in the same
	experimental context. The relationship between suggestibility and
	hypnotic pain reduction appears to be linear in nature. [ABSTRACT

	Practitioner with Special Interests (GPwSI) service delivered within
	Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) involves a process of 'transitional change'
	which impacts on the professional roles of clinicians who may embrace
	or resist change. In addition, the perspective of patients on the
	new roles is important. The objective of the current study is to
	explore the attitudes and views of stakeholders to the provision
	of a respiratory GPwSI service within the six PCTs in Leicester,
	UK. METHODS: Using a qualitative design, GPs, nurses, secondary care
	doctors, nurse specialists, physiotherapists, a healthcare manager
	and patients with respiratory disease took part in focus groups and
	in-depth interviews. RESULTS: The 25 participants expressed diverse
	opinions about the challenge of integrating specialist services with
	generalist care and the specific contribution that GPs might make
	to the care of people with chronic respiratory disease. A range of
	potential roles for a respiratory GPwSI, working as part of a multi-disciplinary
	team, were suggested, and a number of practical issues were highlighted.
	Success of the GPwSI role is deemed to be dependent on having the
	trust of their primary and secondary care colleagues as well as patients,
	credibility as a practitioner, and being politically astute thereby
	enabling them to act as a champion supporting the transition process
	within the local health service. CONCLUSION: The introduction of
	a respiratory GPwSI service represents a challenge to traditional
	roles which, whilst broadly acceptable, raised a number of important
	issues for the stakeholders in our study. These perspectives need
	to be taken into account if workforce change is to be successfully

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Choosing an adequate measurement instrument depends on
	the proposed use of the instrument, the concept to be measured, the
	measurement properties (e.g. internal consistency, reproducibility,
	content and construct validity, responsiveness, and interpretability),
	the requirements, the burden for subjects, and costs of the available
	instruments. As far as measurement properties are concerned, there
	are no sufficiently specific standards for the evaluation of measurement
	properties of instruments to measure health status, and also no explicit
	criteria for what constitutes good measurement properties. In this
	paper we describe the protocol for the COSMIN study, the objective
	of which is to develop a checklist that contains COnsensus-based
	Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments, including
	explicit criteria for satisfying these standards. We will focus on
	evaluative health related patient-reported outcomes (HR-PROs), i.e.
	patient-reported health measurement instruments used in a longitudinal
	design as an outcome measure, excluding health care related PROs,
	such as satisfaction with care or adherence. The COSMIN standards
	will be made available in the form of an easily applicable checklist.
	METHOD: An international Delphi study will be performed to reach
	consensus on which and how measurement properties should be assessed,
	and on criteria for good measurement properties. Two sources of input
	will be used for the Delphi study: (1) a systematic review of properties,
	standards and criteria of measurement properties found in systematic
	reviews of measurement instruments, and (2) an additional literature
	search of methodological articles presenting a comprehensive checklist
	of standards and criteria. The Delphi study will consist of four
	(written) Delphi rounds, with approximately 30 expert panel members
	with different backgrounds in clinical medicine, biostatistics, psychology,
	and epidemiology. The final checklist will subsequently be field-tested
	by assessing the inter-rater reproducibility of the checklist. DISCUSSION:
	Since the study will mainly be anonymous, problems that are commonly
	encountered in face-to-face group meetings, such as the dominance
	of certain persons in the communication process, will be avoided.
	By performing a Delphi study and involving many experts, the likelihood
	that the checklist will have sufficient credibility to be accepted
	and implemented will increase.},

	polyp recurrence. Adherence of the group with the rofecoxib study
	and the questionnaire was 100%. The sample included 24 men (77%)
	and 7 women of mean age 66+/-9 years; 90% were married, 42% were
	employed. A family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) was reported
	by 29%. The main reasons for adherence reported by the patients (on

	the chance to prevent CRC (9.1+/-1.9), and participation in a multicenter

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To understand how the technology of electronic prescription
	(e Rx) can transform the community pharmacist's role through its
	effects on professionalization. We define professionalization as
	a pharmaceutical practice centred on clinical activities and made
	possible by the establishment of professional pharmaceutical services.
	METHODS: We asked 12 community pharmacists who had participated in
	an e Rx pilot project in the Canadian province of Quebec to fill
	out a qualitative survey on their experience. We then analyzed the
	pharmacists' perceptions of this new technology using a conceptual
	framework based on the Davenport typology that presents an exhaustive
	list of mechanisms, specific to Information Technologies, and thus
	e-Rx, that can potentially modify information management process
	and then the role of pharmacists. RESULTS: The pharmacists identified
	five main mechanisms by which e Rx could affect the professionalization
	of community pharmacists: analytical capabilities of the pharmacist
	and physician, dissemination of knowledge, integration of process
	tasks, process automation and elimination of intermediaries. These
	mechanisms can assist pharmacists in exercising their professional
	judgement by improving the quality of available information and facilitate
	the execution of prescriptions by improving the quality of orders.
	E Rx technology can also strengthen pharmacists' credibility as medication
	specialists in the eyes of both patients and physicians. Thus, e
	Rx can become a collaborative technology to the extent that it improves
	collaboration between community pharmacists and prescribing physicians.
	However, the potential benefits of this technology would appear to
	depend on its characteristics and how prescribing physicians use
	it. CONCLUSIONS: E-Rx proposes ways of working and communicating
	that were previously unimaginable. These new possibilities pave the
	way for transformations that can significantly increase the professionalization
	of community pharmacists. The results of this study indicate that
	community pharmacists have a favourable opinion of e Rx, believing
	it can be an ally in their professionalization.},

	an approach used to identify fruits and vegetables to target for
	a child focused dietary change intervention. Second, to evaluate
	the concept of fruit and vegetable changeability and feasibility
	of applying it in a community setting. METHODS: Steps for identifying
	changeable fruits and vegetables include (1) identifying a dietary
	database (2) defining geographic and (3) personal demographics that
	characterize the food environment and (4) determining which fruits
	and vegetables are likely to improve during an intervention. The
	validity of these methods are evaluated for credibility using data
	collected from quasi-experimental, controlled design among 7-9 year
	old children (n = 304) participating in a tutoring or mentoring program
	in St. Louis, MO. Using a 28-item food frequency questionnaire, parents
	were asked to recall for their child how often foods were eaten the
	past 7 days. This questionnaire was repeated eight months later (response
	rate 84%). T-test analyses are used to determine mean serving differences
	from baseline to post test. RESULTS: The mean serving differences
	from baseline to post test were significant for moderately eaten
	fruits (p < .001), however, not for vegetables (p = .312). Among
	the intervention group, significantly more children ate grapes (p
	< .001), peaches (p = .022), cantaloupe (p < .001), and spinach (p
	= .044) at post testing - all identified as changeable with information
	tailored to participants. CONCLUSION: Data driven, food focused interventions
	directed at a priority population are feasible and practical. An
	empirical evaluation of the assumptions associated with these methods
	supports this novel approach. However, results may indicate that
	these methods may be more relevant to fruits than vegetables. This
	process can be applied to diverse populations for many dietary outcomes.
	Intervention strategies that target only those changeable fruits
	and vegetables are innovative and warrant further study.},

	perceptions. In addition, the research approach emphasizes human
	behaviour and social interaction. It explores the quality of a phenomenon,
	not the quantity. This article outlines the major characteristics
	of qualitative research methodology and gives applications and examples.
	The aim of qualitative methodology is to develop new knowledge based
	on participants' own beliefs and experiences, not on pre-defined,
	testable hypotheses. It is inductive rather than deductive, and it
	is interpretative rather than predictive. The design is flexible,
	iterative and emergent and therefore requires of the researcher an
	ability to change and adapt the research process in accordance with
	emerging results. Qualitative research is thus different from quantitative
	research as it allows for flexibility throughout the research process.
	Several data collection methods can be used, such as individual interviews,
	focus group discussions or participant observations, in order to
	gain a deeper understanding of health, illness and rehabilitation.
	It can be used in combination with quantitative studies, but also
	as a research method of its own. In health research, the qualitative
	methodology has gained increasing credibility during the last decade.
	However, it is not yet frequently used in rehabilitation research.
	As rehabilitation outcomes are dependent on people's attitudes, thoughts
	and motivation regarding the rehabilitation process, and as the rehabilitation
	process in itself builds on social interaction, studies with a qualitative
	design could become useful tools in the development and improvement
	of rehabilitation.},

	sessions enabling patients to rate treatment expectancy based on
	their actual perception of the treatment. Dimensions of recovery
	included perceived recovery, functional status, and pain intensity
	(back and leg) at the 3-month and 12-month follow-up. It was found
	that high treatment expectancy was associated with a favorable outcome
	on perceived recovery and functional status, both at the 3 and the
	12-month follow-up. Taking pain medication and a poor functional
	status at baseline were associated with poor perceived recovery and
	functional status at both follow-up measurements. Leg pain and back
	pain at baseline were associated with residual leg and back pain
	at the 3 and the 12-month follow-up, respectively. The results for
	perceived recovery and functional status were rather robust. However,
	for leg pain and back pain, the results were less stable. Apparently,
	the clinical course to recovery of residual leg pain and residual
	back pain is not strongly influenced by these indicators.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: RAFAELA is a modern system of patient classification.
	In the last few years the system has become widely used in Finland
	and has aroused international interest. It comprises three parts:
	(1) The Oulu Patient Classification (OPC) instrument and (2) a file
	on nurse resources. Using these, the daily nursing care intensity,
	expressed as OPC points per nurse, can be calculated. The existing
	nursing care intensity can then be compared with the optimal by using
	the third instrument, (3) the Professional Assessment of Optimal
	Nursing Care Intensity Level (PAONCIL). This is a daily questionnaire
	that nurses complete in a 2-month period at intervals every few years.
	The daily workload is scored from -3 to +3, where zero is the optimal
	level. The optimal nursing care intensity per nurse is then defined
	by using linear regression analysis. No expensive time studies are
	needed. AIMS: This paper reports on a study which aimed to identify
	the minimum requirements for determining optimal nursing care intensity
	that allow the results to be accepted as correct, in terms of: length
	of the PAONCIL examination period, PAONCIL questionnaire response
	rate, explanatory power of the regression analysis and mean values
	of the OPC and PAONCIL instruments. DESIGN: The results of analyses
	of optimal nursing care intensity from 61 wards in eight Finnish
	hospitals for the period 1997-2001 are presented. The data do not
	contain any information about the identity of the patients. METHODS:
	Linear regression analysis, one-way analysis of variance, t-tests
	and correlation analysis were used, as well as parameters of distribution
	of the data. RESULTS: The results of the analysis of optimal nursing
	care intensity can be regarded as reliable if the PAONCIL response
	rate is above 70%, the period of examination is at least 3-4 weeks,
	the mean PAONCIL value is below 0.65 and the explanatory power is
	above 25%. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the RAFAELA system, the optimal
	nursing care intensity of a ward can be reliably determined. The
	prerequisites for achieving reliable results were clear and mostly
	fulfilled. Because a study period shorter than that which has previously
	been the practice is enough, the use of this system will be easier
	than before. The credibility and usefulness of the RAFAELA system
	have thus received considerable additional confirmation.},

	One hundred and twenty-five self-reported religious Jewish individuals
	with elevated levels of stress and worry received SIT (n=36),
	progressive muscle relaxation (PMR, n=42), or a waitlist control
	condition (WLC, n=47). SIT and PMR participants accessed Internet-based
	treatment on a daily basis for a period of 2 weeks. All participants
	completed self-report assessments at pre-treatment (T1), post-treatment
	(T2), and 6-8-week follow-up (T3).Results SIT participants reported
	large improvements in primary (stress and worry) and secondary (depression
	and intolerance of uncertainty) outcomes, and moderate improvements
	in spiritual outcomes (positive/negative religious coping; trust/mistrust
	in God). SIT participants reported greater belief in treatment credibility,
	greater expectancies from treatment and greater treatment satisfaction
	than PMR participants. SIT participants also reported better improvements
	in both primary outcomes (stress and worry), one of two secondary
	outcomes (intolerance of uncertainty), and two of four spiritual
	outcomes (positive religious coping and mistrust in God) compared
	to the WLC group, whereas PMR and WLC participants did not differ
	on most outcomes.Conclusions Results of this investigation offer
	initial support for the efficacy of SIT for the treatment of subclinical
	anxiety symptoms among religious Jews. Results further suggest that
	it is important to incorporate spiritual content into treatment to
	help facilitate the delivery of psychotherapy to religious individuals.},

	in many pediatric migraine treatment studies and has demonstrated
	a consistent therapeutic effect. No published studies to date have
	compared this treatment modality with credible attention control
	using biofeedback technology. METHODS: Thirty-six children and adolescents
	(mean age: 12.8 years), as well as the mothers and fathers of these
	children enrolled in the study, were randomly assigned to the three
	groups. Thirty-four children completed treatment. Both treatment
	groups received four sessions of biofeedback training and a portable
	biofeedback device for home practice. Ratings of treatment credibility
	showed that the children rated the two treatments as equally credible.
	Assessment included anxiety and depression questionnaires for the
	children and both of their parents. RESULTS: Children who had been
	assigned to the HWB group were more likely to achieve clinical improvement
	in migraine after treatment than the children in the HCB group. Treatment
	gains were maintained up to 6 months after treatment. Home practice
	data reflected a general increase in temperature in the HWB group
	and a decrease in temperature for the HCB group. CONCLUSIONS: The
	results of this study confirm the findings of earlier pediatric migraine
	biofeedback treatment studies and also provide support for the specific
	effect of treatments including stress management and HWB. Future

	could be made on the basis of three parameters: a critical appraisal
	of available scientific evidence, clinical experience (including
	knowledge of the individual patient and his/her attack characteristics),
	and, of course, patient preferences. Patients are likely to prefer
	agents that offer rapid relief, pain-free status within 2 hours,
	no recurrence or need for rescue medication, extended time to recurrence
	(if present), consistency of therapeutic effect over multiple attacks,
	oral administration. good tolerability, safety, and minimal drug
	interactions. Fortunately, a number of specific therapies now are
	available which place these objectives within the patient's reach.
	Ongoing barriers to optimal migraine care include underrecognition,
	underconsultation, undertreatment, restrictions imposed by insurance
	companies, and exaggerated concerns regarding the safety of the triptans.
	Overcoming these barriers is likely to prove a more important contribution
	to patient care than endeavoring to establish the relative merits
	of one triptan over another. We have described in detail a number
	of strategies for improving recognition and treatment of migraine.
	Many headache specialists now believe that recurrent episodes of
	disabling headache, with a stable pattern over years, should be viewed
	as migraine until proven otherwise. In the end, this may represent
	the most useful paradigm in the primary care setting, where time
	is of the essence. Studies to validate this approach are needed.
	Acute treatment intervention that is based on scientific evidence,
	clinical experience, and patients' needs and desires will provide
	better outcomes than those presently obtained. Preliminary evidence
	favors early intervention with oral triptans, and randomized, prospective,
	double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, ideally employing a crossover
	design, are required to confirm this. The US Consortium's evidence-based
	guidelines, the National Headache Foundation's standards of care,
	and the Canadian guidelines have applied the standards of scientific
	inquiry to the field of headache management and "translation" of
	these guidelines into practical instruments for clinicians through
	vehicles such as the Primary Care Network's Patient-Centered Strategies
	for Effective Management of Migraine should raise the general standard
	of care for patients with migraine. Last, but far from least, initiatives
	undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) will add credibility
	to the many layfolk and professionals who have struggled to present
	headache as a disabling disorder worthy of scientific investigation
	and aggressive medical management. The WHO states: "These common
	complaints impose a significant health burden ... Despite this, both
	the public and the majority of healthcare professionals tend to perceive
	headache as a minor or trivial complaint. As a result, the physical,
	emotional, social and economic burdens of headache are poorly acknowledged
	in comparison with those of other, less prevalent, neurologic disorders."

	with a complaint of back pain that persisted for at least 3 months.
	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the first experiment, subjects received six
	insertions of real needles and six pokes with a toothpick in a guidetube
	in a two-period crossover design. In the second experiment, subjects
	were randomly assigned to receive either a complete treatment with
	real acupuncture needles or a simulated treatment using a toothpick
	in a guidetube. OUTCOMES: In the first experiment, we compared subjects'
	perceptions about which implement was used for each "insertion" while
	in the second, we compared the perceptions (e.g., acupuncturist's
	warmth and caring, the reasonableness of acupuncture as a treatment)
	and pain relief of those who received an acupuncture treatment using
	needles to those receiving simulated acupuncture. RESULTS: In the
	first experiment, the toothpick insertions were perceived as slightly
	more like real needling than the real needling (mean ratings of 2.8
	and 2.1, respectively; p = 0.08). In the second experiment, 52% percent
	of those receiving the simulated needling versus 65% of those receiving
	real acupuncture believed they were "definitely" or "probably" receiving
	real acupuncture (p = 0.33). Perceptions of acupuncture, as measured
	by a credibility questionnaire, were similar in the two groups. Those
	receiving real acupuncture were more likely to report immediate pain
	relief, and this was the factor most predictive of the subject's
	belief about which treatment they had received (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS:
	The simulated acupuncture procedure evaluated in this study represents
	a reasonable control treatment for acupuncture-naive individuals
	in randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of acupuncture
	for low-back pain.},

	the process of implementation of an epidemiological survey to assess
	HIV-related behavioural and biological factors in Chennai city in
	South India and to suggest an ethical framework for conducting similar
	assessment activities in developing-country settings. A survey was

	urban communities (slums) as part of a community-based HIV/STD-prevention
	trial. Administration of the survey was preceded by extensive community
	contact and household visits to inform community members about the
	trial and assessment activities. Formative research further strengthened
	rapport with community, highlighted community concerns, and identified
	HIV-related risk behaviours that informed questionnaire design. The
	process of obtaining informed consent began before assessment activities
	and provided an opportunity for individuals to discuss participation
	with their families and friends. Privacy during assessment, comprehensive
	follow-up care for those who tested positive for HIV/STDs, such as
	nutritional and prevention counselling, referral services for opportunistic
	infections, and antenatal-care options for pregnant women increased
	trust and credibility of the project. The sustained availability
	of trial staff to facilitate access to resources to address non-HIV/STD-related
	felt-needs further strengthened participation of the community members.
	These resources included liaison services with local government to
	obtain public services, such as water and electricity and resources,
	to address concerns, such as alcohol abuse and domestic violence.
	Based on this experience, an ethical framework is suggested for conducting
	HIV epidemiological risk assessment in developing countries. This
	framework discusses the role of community participation, transparent
	and comprehensive informed consent, timely dissemination of results,
	and access to follow-up care for those living with HIV/STDs.},

	to three experimental and one control group. Subjects were surveyed
	with one baseline questionnaire and one post-intervention questionnaire,

	were tested: 1) cards representing different statements related to
	previous dental experiences, possible reasons for attending (pros)
	and not attending (cons) dental appointments, and preferences for
	future treatment. Cards were selected based on individual priority;
	2) a brief, structured telephone interview based on Motivational
	Interviewing. The instruments were tested separately (groups I and
	II) and in combination (group III). Subjects in the control group
	(group IV) were given conventional health education. RESULTS: Subjects

	To further study the potential beneficial role of prescriptive exercise

	in reducing fears of anxiety-related sensations (anxiety sensitivity).
	Methods: We randomly assigned 60 participants with elevated levels
	of anxiety sensitivity to a 2-week exercise intervention, a 2-week
	exercise plus cognitive restructuring intervention, or a waitlist
	control condition. Assessment of outcome was completed at pretreatment,

	We found that both exercise conditions led to clinically significant
	changes in anxiety sensitivity that were superior to the waitlist
	condition, representing a large controlled effect size (d=2.15).
	Adding a cognitive component did not facilitate the effects of the

	sensitivity mediated the beneficial effects of exercise on anxious

	MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised adult and juvenile males
	of grade one correction categories and prisoners from the prison
	for juveniles in Martin, as well as females prisoners in Nitra. Preventive
	activities were implemented in May 1998 in the form of discussions
	concerning topics related to HIV/AIDS infection. Saliva was collected
	for the presence of HIV antibodies and a questionnaire regarding
	sexual practice was completed. RESULTS: 32 persons [8 adult males
	(25%), 6 juvenile males (18.7%) and 18 females (56%)] were voluntarily
	tested for the presence of HIV antibodies in saliva. Nobody was HIV-positive.
	75 persons (20 adult males, 30 juvenile males and 25 females) were
	involved in the study of risk behaviour. 40.8% participants had primary
	education, 28.2% secondary education, 2.8% were students of universities
	and 28.2% were apprenticies. 60% inmates (mostly females) were religious.
	Juvenile males reported the highest number of partners while females
	the smallest (p < 0.001). The more partners were reported by respondents,
	the lower was condom usage (p < 0.07). 47.6% females relied on credibility
	of partners, while 75% adult males and 50% adolescent males did not
	use protection. 0% females, 5% adult males and 10.3% juvenile males
	reported to have homosexual contacts outside prison while 19%, 5.6%

  abstract = {Regarding national and international trade of animals and animal products,
	certificates are required to document specific health levels. The
	credibility of such certificates depends on the quality of the data
	used to establish the status. Credibility also depends on the quality
	of the design and protocols used in the data-gathering process (i.e.
	on the quality of the surveillance-and-monitoring systems (SMS) and
	on the quality of the veterinary administrative systems (VAdminS)).
	The major requirements for the assessment of the SMS and VAdminS
	are: objectivity, accuracy, transparency, practicality, quantitative
	in nature. To assess the quality of SMS and VAdminS, systems analysis
	might provide a suitable framework. Systems analysis requires the
	identification and description of all components of the system-how
	they interact with each other and with other systems. Graphical methods
	(e.g. fault trees) are available to support this procedure. To assess
	the quality of SMS, scoring systems have been suggested. Their main
	weakness is the inherent subjectiveness. Alternatively, performance
	indicators (PI) could be used. For the assessment of VAdminS, questionnaires
	have been developed and applied. Their main limitations are that
	they focus on the input rather than on the output and that they are
	purely descriptive in nature. Thus, comparisons between countries
	are almost impossible. Semi-quantitative questionnaires using scores
	now are being developed and tested, although their limitations will
	be similar to those mentioned above. Another approach is the use
	of risk assessment including standardised data files assembled by
	countries volunteering to be assessed. This was applied successfully
	by the European Union (EU) in the geographic risk assessment for
	bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). In general, the publication
	and documentation of veterinary systems needs to be encouraged to
	make them accessible to peer review.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the curricula contents, and presents data to
	evaluate the implementation, process and immediate post-test knowledge
	of Project Towards No Tobacco Use (Project TNT). Four different school-based
	tobacco use prevention curricula were developed to counteract the
	effects of three types of tobacco use acquisition variables typically
	addressed within a comprehensive social influences program: (1) peer
	approval for using tobacco (normative social influence), (2) incorrect
	social informational provided about tobacco use (information social
	influence) and (3) lack of knowledge or misperceptions about physical
	consequences resulting from tobacco use. Three curricula were designed
	to counteract the effects of single acquisition variables, whereas
	a fourth curriculum was designed to counteract the effects of combined
	social and physical consequences-related influences. These curricula
	were delivered to seventh grade students by trained project health
	educators to maximize implementation. 'Program' schools, those schools
	that received one of these curricula, were compared to 'control'
	schools that provided asystematic health education delivered by school
	personnel. A total of five conditions were contrasted through use
	of a randomized experiment involving 48 southern California junior
	high schools. This paper documents high levels of implementation
	in all program conditions. Also, favorable process ratings were obtained
	across the four program conditions, using multiple measures and sources
	of ratings (students, health educators and classroom teachers who
	observed curricula delivery). Finally, knowledge item sets completed
	by the students demonstrated discriminant validity across all five
	conditions. Because the program conditions were discriminable, yet
	were quite similar in implementation and process ratings, planned
	future study of behavioral outcomes can be interpreted as relatively
	uncontaminated by delivery or credibility confounds.},

	of use of research findings in practice, and the level of research
	skills of chiropractors and massage therapists in Canada. Predictors
	of application of research findings in clinical practice were also
	explored. METHODS: A survey was mailed to members of the College
	of Chiropractors of Alberta (n = 833) and the Massage Therapist Association
	of Alberta (n = 650). Univariate and logistic regression analysis
	were conducted with SPSS and Stata. RESULTS: A total of 483 questionnaires
	were returned (response rate, 32.6%). Chiropractors and massage therapists
	reported an overall positive perception toward research, acknowledging
	the importance of research to validate their practice. Although both
	groups felt comfortable using the library, they had little confidence
	in their research skills and overall application of research in practice
	was limited. Significant differences were found between the 2 professional
	groups, with chiropractors reporting more research skills and evidence-based
	practice. Primary discipline, frequent referral to peer-reviewed
	journals, and strong agreement with the statement that "research
	adds credibility to my discipline" were predictors of research application
	in practice. CONCLUSION: It appears that in Canada neither chiropractors
	nor massage therapists consistently apply research in practice, which
	may result from a lack of research education and research skills.
	The differences between the 2 professional groups may be attributed
	to the chiropractic profession's relatively more research-focused
	professional training. Strategies to encourage greater research uptake
	and evidence-based behavior by practitioners include professional
	association incentives, such as education credits or practitioner
	cooperatives that would provide time and support for research.},

	The reliability of this Internet-based treatment programme for social

	The present study examined the efficacy of a transdiagnostic Internet-based

	one anxiety disorder within the same program (the Anxiety Program).
	Eighty six individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for generalized
	anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, and/or social phobia were
	randomly assigned to a treatment group, or to a waitlist control
	group. Treatment consisted of CBT based online educational lessons
	and homework assignments, weekly email or telephone contact from
	a clinical psychologist, access to a moderated online discussion
	forum, and automated emails. An intention-to-treat model using the
	baseline-observation-carried-forward principle was employed for data
	analyses. Seventy-five percent of treatment group participants completed
	all 6 lessons within the 8 week program. Post-treatment data was
	collected from 38/40 treatment group and 38/38 control group participants,
	and 3-month follow-up data was collected from 32/40 treatment group
	participants. Relative to controls, treatment group participants
	reported significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety as measured by
	the Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 Item, Social Phobia Screening
	Questionnaire, and the Panic Disorder Severity Rating Scale - Self
	Report Scale, but not on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire, with
	corresponding between-groups effect sizes (Cohen's d) at post-treatment
	of 0.78, 0.43, 0.43, and 0.20, respectively. The clinician spent
	a total mean time of 46min per person over the program, participants
	rated the procedure as moderately acceptable, and gains were sustained
	at follow-up. Modifications to the Anxiety program, based on post-treatment
	feedback from treatment group participants, were associated with
	improved outcomes in the control group. These results indicate that
	transdiagnostic programs for anxiety disorders may be successfully
	administered via the Internet.},

  abstract = {Objective: In two randomized controlled trials Titov et al. demonstrated
	significant benefit from an Internet- and email-based treatment programme
	for social phobia: the Shyness programme. Data are presented about
	the longer term outcomes (6 months after treatment), cost-effectiveness
	relative to face-to-face treatment, and the acceptability of the
	programme to participants. Method: Participants completed outcome
	and acceptability questionnaires at 6 months after treatment. Repeated
	measures analyses of variance were calculated using an intention-to-treat
	design. Cost-effectiveness in years lived with disability averted
	were calculated based on between-group effect sizes. Results: A total
	of 59% of treatment group participants completed the 6 month follow-up
	questionnaires. Between post-treatment and 6 month follow up participants
	continued to make improvements in symptoms of social phobia, while
	maintaining improvements in mood, psychological distress, and disability.
	At 6 month follow up the mean within-group effect size (Cohen's d)
	for the two social phobia measures increased from 1.2 to 1.4. Cost-effectiveness
	in years lived with disability (YLD) averted was calculated as one-quarter
	that of face-to-face group treatment, or $AUD1495 for one YLD gained,
	compared to $AUD5686/YLD gained. Participants rated the Internet
	treatment to be as effective and helpful as face-to-face treatment.
	Conclusions: The present results confirm the reliability of the short-term
	findings reported in the first two Shyness programmes. The procedure
	appears to be very cost-effective, and acceptable to participants.
	These data provide further support for the development of Internet-based
	virtual clinics for common mental disorders. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

	study. The subjects were 955 community residents enrolled in the
	Community Education Program on Medication Use (CEPMU) between September
	2003 and January 2004 in Taiwan. The program was a pharmacist-facilitated
	national education program implemented at 31 community universities
	nationwide. The education program consisted of 14 lectures that were
	delivered over a 4-month period. A questionnaire was administered
	before and after the program to survey the subjects on their usual
	drug-information sources, their evaluation of the credibility of
	the drug-information sources, and their perceptions of the roles
	and functions of pharmacists in Taiwan. Paired t-test was used to
	analyze the difference between pre- and post-tests with a significant
	level set at 0.05 a priori. RESULTS: At the end of the program, the
	subjects were more likely to request drug information from healthcare
	professionals as compared to the baseline (p < 0.05). They also had
	more confidence in the information provided by the community pharmacists
	(p < 0.05) and had a better understanding of the roles and functions
	of pharmacists (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The national medication education

	combined with interactive group discussions on hospital specialists'
	adherence to evidence-based guidelines for drug treatment of common
	diseases issued by a regional Drug and Therapeutics Committee. METHODS:
	Intervention study performed at 17 clinics at a university hospital
	in a Swedish metropolitan health region with comparative clinics
	at a second university hospital as a control. Prescribing profiles
	based on aggregate pharmacy dispensing data were presented for the
	physicians in interactive group discussions. Deviations from the
	guidelines were discussed at each clinic and specific goals of improvement
	were formulated. The effect was assessed by pre- and post-intervention
	comparison of the adherence to guidelines for all drugs and within
	11 selected therapeutic areas. The credibility and usefulness of
	the prescribing profiles were evaluated by a questionnaire. RESULTS:
	The adherence to pharmaceutical products within the pharmacological
	groups stated in the guideline increased by 2.8%-units at the intervention
	hospital compared with 0.8%-units at the control hospital. The adherence
	to drug substance increased by 0.4%-units at the intervention hospital
	while it decreased by 1.8%-units at the control hospital. For 8 of
	11 pre-defined specific goals of improvement, the change in adherence
	was more positive at the intervention hospital. Most doctors considered
	the feedback provided clear and relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Interactive
	group discussions with prescribing profiles were found to be useful
	in improving hospital specialists' adherence to guidelines. However,
	the effect on the overall adherence was modest, indicating the importance
	of clear messages for improvement and relevant guidelines for the
	prescribing of specialist drugs but also more precise methods for
	evaluating the effect of real-life-interventions.},

	Prescriptions dispensed during October-December 1999 and 2000, respectively,
	were analysed for 38 Primary Health Care centres (PHC) in Stockholm
	participating in an intervention project with the aim of increasing
	cost-consciousness among GPs. Focus was on quality of prescribing
	rather than on costs. Prescribing profiles focusing on the number
	of drugs constituting 90% of the volume (= DU90%) and the adherence
	to local drug committee guideline within this segment were presented
	for the prescribers. The credibility and usefulness of the method
	was evaluated by a questionnaire. RESULT: Among the PHCs, the total
	number of drugs prescribed varied between 358 and 674. The number
	of drugs in the DU90%-segment varied between 117 and 194. The adherence
	to guideline within this segment varied between 56% and 74% and increased

	Conference on the professional practices of French dermatologists
	treating immunocompetent patients with mucocutaneous herpes simplex
	infection (ocular herpes excluded). This conference was preceded
	by a survey that revealed a lack of homogeneity in practices. METHODS:
	A questionnaire (similar to that of 2001) was submitted in 2003 to
	205 dermatologists, half of whom had responded to the first survey.
	It contained 40 questions about diagnosis, prevention and treatment.
	The analysis compared the answers given in the 2001 survey with those
	of dermatologists either answering for the first time or answering
	again in 2003. RESULTS: In 2003, the response rate was of 96% (43%
	in 2001). Statistically significant changes were obtained for the
	following items: better knowledge of situations requiring a precise
	history of herpes infection, dramatic decrease in prescribing herpes
	serological tests, increase in prescribing serological tests for
	other sexually transmitted diseases in patients with genital herpes,
	better knowledge of prevention strategies, decreased intention of
	prescribing topical antiviral agents, increased intention of using
	oral antiviral agents in patients with recurrent genital or orofacial
	herpes and those with recurrent erythema multiforme. No statistically
	significant improvement was noted regarding: failure to prescribe
	any direct virology test to confirm herpes infection before prescribing
	long-term viral treatment, high use of "prophylactic" oral antivirals
	in patients with recurrence of UV-induced herpes. DISCUSSION: The
	fact that the telephone survey was conducted by a dermatologist rather
	than a service provider could account for the very high response
	rate observed. The utilization of a part of the sample of practitioners
	surveyed in 2001 lends credibility to the results. Our study nevertheless
	remains a survey of prescribing intentions rather than of actual
	practice. While the 2001 consensus conference on the practices of
	French dermatologists appears to have had a clear effect regarding
	numerous items, considerable progress is still required in certain
	diagnostic and therapeutic areas.},
